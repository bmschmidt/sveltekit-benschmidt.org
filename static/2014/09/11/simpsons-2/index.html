						This is a post about several different things, but maybe it&#8217;s got something for
						everyone. It starts with 1) some thoughts on why we want comparisons between seasons of
						the Simpsons, hits on 2) some previews of some yet-more-interesting Bookworm browsers
						out there, then 3) digs into some meaty comparisons about what changes about the
						Simpsons over time, before finally 4) talking about the internal story structure of the
						Simpsons and what these tools can tell us about narrative formalism, and maybe why
						I&#8217;d care.
					</p>

					<p>
						It&#8217;s prompted by a simple question. I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of media
						attention for my Simpsons browser. As a result of that, I need some additional sound
						bytes about what changes in the Simpsons. The Bookworm line charts, which remain all
						that most people have seen, are great for exploring individual words; but they
						don&#8217;t tell you _what words to look for. _This is a general problem with tools like
						Bookworm, Ngrams, and the like: they don&#8217;t tell you what&#8217;s interesting.
						(I&#8217;d argue, actually, that it&#8217;s not really a problem; we really want tools
						that will useful for addressing specific questions, not tools that generate new
						questions.)
					</p>

					<p>
						The platform, though, can handle those sorts of queries (particularly on a small corpus
						like the Simpsons) with only a bit of tweaking, most of which I&#8217;ve already done.
						To find interesting shifts, you need:
					</p>

					<p>
						1) To be able to search without specifying words, but to get results back faceted by
						words;
					</p>

					<p>2) Some metric of &#8220;interestingness&#8221; to use.</p>

					<p>
						Number 1 is architecturally easy, although mildly sort of expensive. Bookworm&#8217;s
						architecture has, for some time, prioritized an approach where &#8220;it&#8217;s all
						metadata&#8221;; that includes word counts. So just as you can group by the year of
						publication, you can group by the word used. Easy peasy; it takes more processing power
						than grouping by year, but it&#8217;s still doable.
					</p>

					<p>
						Metrics of interestingness are a notoriously hard problem; but it&#8217;s not hard to
						find a _partial _solution, which is all we really need. The built-in searches for
						Bookworm focus on counts of words and counts of texts. The natural (and intended) use
						are the built-in limits like &#8220;percentage of texts&#8221; and &#8220;words per
						million,&#8221; but given those figures for two distinct corpora (the search set and the
						broader comparison sets) also make it possible to calculate all sorts of other things.
						Some are pretty straightforward (&#8220;average text length&#8221;); but others are
						actual computational tools in themselves, including  TF-IDF and two different forms of
						Dunning&#8217;s Log-Likelihood. (And those are just the cheap metrics; you could even
						run a full topic model and ship the results back, if that wasn&#8217;t a crazy thing to
						do).
					</p>

					<p>
						So I added in, for the time being at least, a Dunning calculator as an alternate return
						count type to the Bookworm API. (A fancy new pandas backend makes this a lot easier than
						the old way.) So I can set two corpora, and compare the results of each to each.
					</p>

					<p>
						To plow through a bunch of different Dunning scores, some kind of visualization is
						useful.
					</p>

					<p>
						Last time I looked at the Dunning formula on this blog, I found that
						<a
							href="http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/10/dunning-statistics-on-authors.html"
							target="_blank"
							>Dunning scores are nice to look in wordclouds</a
						>. I&#8217;m as snooty about word clouds as everyone else in the field. But for
						representing Dunning scores, I actually think that wordclouds are one of the most
						space-efficient representations possible. (This is following up on how Elijah Meeks uses
						wordclouds for topic model glancing, and how the old MONK project used to display
						Dunning scores).
					</p>

					<p>
						There&#8217;s aren&#8217;t a lot of other options. In the past I&#8217;ve made charts
						for Dunning scores as bar charts: for example, the strongly female and the most strongly
						male words in negative reviews of history professors on online sites. (This is from a
						project I haven&#8217;t mentioned before online, I don&#8217;t think; super interesting
						stuff, to me at least). So &#8220;jerk,&#8221; &#8220;funny,&#8221; and
						&#8220;arrogant&#8221; are disproportionately present in bad reviews of men;
						&#8220;feminist,&#8221; &#8220;work,&#8221; and &#8220;sweet&#8221; are
						disproportionately present in bad reviews of women.
					</p>

					</p>

					<p>
						This is a nice and precise way to do it, but it&#8217;s a lot of real estate to take up
						for a few dozen words. The exact numbers for Dunning scores barely matter: there&#8217;s
						less harm in the oddities of wordclouds (for instance, longer words seeming more
						important just because of its length).
					</p>

					<p>
						We can fit both aspects of this: the words and the directionality&#8211;by borrowing an
						idea that I think the old MONK website had; colorizing results by direction of bias. So
						here&#8217;s one that I put online recently: a comparison of language in
						&#8220;Deadwood&#8221; (black) and &#8220;The Wire&#8221; (red).
					</p>

					<p>
						<a

								"
								sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"
						/></a>
					</p>

					<p>
						This is a nice comparison, I think; individual characters pop out (the Doc, Al, and
						Wu vs Jimmy and the Mayor); but it also captures the actual way language is used,
						particularly the curses HBO specializes in. (Deadwood has probably established an
						all-time high score on some fucking-cucksucker axis forever; but the Wire more than
						holds it own in the sphere of shit/motherfucker.) This is going to be a forthcoming
						study of profane multi-dimensional spaces, I guess.
					</p>

					<p>Anyhoo. What can that tell us about the Simpsons?</p>

						Here&#8217;s what the log-likelihood plot looks like. Black are words characteristic of
						seasons 2-9 (the good ones); red is seasons 12-19. There&#8217;s much, much less
						that&#8217;s statistically different about two different 80-hour Simpsons runs than two
						 roughly 80-hour HBO shows: that&#8217;s to be expected. And most the differences we do
						find are funny things involving punctuation that have to do with how the Bookworm is put
						together.
					</p>

					<p>
						But: there are a number of things that are definitely real. First is the fall away from
						several character names.

					<p>
						Few characters increase (Lou the cop; Duffman; Artie Ziff, though in only two episodes).

						We do get more, though, of some abstract words. Even though one of the first

					<p>&#8220;Gay&#8221; starts showing up frequently.</p>

					<p>
						Others are just bizarre: The Simpsons used the word &#8220;dumped&#8221; only once in
						the 1990s, and a 19 times in the 2000s. This can&#8217;t mean anything (right?) but
						seems to be true.
					</p>

					<p>
						What about story structure? I found myself, somehow, blathering on to one reporter about
						Joseph Campbell and the hero&#8217;s journey. (Full disclosure: I have never read Joseph
						Campbell, and everything I know about him I learned from Dan Harmon podcasts).
					</p>

					<p>
						But those things are interesting. Here are the words most distinctively from the first
						act (black) and the third act (red). (Ie, minutes 17-21 vs 2-8).

						As I said earlier, school shows up as a first-act word. (Although
						&#8220;screeching,&#8221; here, is clearly from descriptions of the opening credits,
						school remains even when you cut the time back quite a bit, so I don&#8217;t think
						it&#8217;s just credit appearances driving this). And there are a few more data
						integrity issues: elderman is not a Simpsons character, but a screenname for someone who
						edits Simpsons subtitles; www, Transcript, and Synchro are all unigrams about the
						editing process. I&#8217;ll fix these for the big movie bookworm, where possible.
					</p>

					<p>
						That said, we can really learn something about the structural properties of fictional
						stories here.
					</p>

					<p>Lenny is a first act character, Moe a third act one.</p>

					<p>The hero returns from his journey, having changed.</p>

					<p>Two last points.</p>

					<p>
						First, there are no discernably &#8220;middle&#8221; words I can find: comparing the
						middle to the front and back returns only the word &#8220;you,&#8221; which indicates
						greater dialogue but little else.
					</p>

					<p>
						Second: does it matter? Can we get anything more out of the Simpsons through this kind
						of reading than just sitting back to watch? Usually, I&#8217;d say that it&#8217;s up to
						the watcher: but assuming that you take television at all seriously, I actually think
						the answer may be &#8220;yes.&#8221; (Particularly given whose birthday it is today). TV
						shows are formulaic. This can be a weakness, but if we accept them as formulaically
						constructed, seeing how the creators are playing around with form can make us appreciate
						them better, better appreciate how they make us feel, and how they work.
					</p>

					<p>
						Murder mysteries are like this: half the fun to all the ITV British murder mysteries is
						predicting who will be the victim of murder number 2 about a half hour in; all the fun
						of Law and Order is guessing which of the four-or-so templates you&#8217;re in Wrongful
						accusation? Unjust acquittal? It was the first guy all along? (And isn&#8217;t it fun
						when the cops come back in the second half hour?)
					</p>

					<p>
						But the conscious play on structures themselves are often fantastic. The
						<a

							target="_blank"
							>first clip-show episode of</a
						>
						_<a
							href="http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/community-paradigms-of-human-memory-54827"
							target="_blank"
							>Community</a
						> _is basically that; essentially no plot, but instead a weird set of riffs on the
						conventions the show has set for itself that verges on a deconstruction of them. One
						could fantasize that we&#8217;re getting to the point where the standard TV formats are
						about as widespread, as formulaic, and as malleable as sonata form was for Haydn and
						Beethoven. What made those two great in particular was their use of the expectations
						built into the form. Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to know how the sausage is made; but
						sometimes, knowing just gets you better sausage.
					</p>

					<p>
						And it&#8217;s just purely interesting.
						<a href="www.matthewjockers.net" target="_blank">Matt Jockers</a> has been looking
						recently at novels and their repeating forms; that&#8217;s super-exciting work. The
						(more formulaic?) mass media genres would provide a nice counterpoint to that.
					</p>

					<p>
						The big, 80,000 movie/TV episode browser isn&#8217;t broken down by minute yet:
						I&#8217;m not sure if it will be for the first release. (It would instantly become an
						8-million text version, which makes it slower). But I&#8217;ll definitely be putting
						something together that makes act-structure possible.
