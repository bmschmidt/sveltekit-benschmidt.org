- title: 'Landscape of Biomedicine'
  description: |
    A visualization and narrative description of 21 million biomedical abstracts combining 
    scrolling, search, and interactive zoom.
    In collaboration with Rita Gonzalez-Marquez, Dmitry Kobak, and others at Berens Lab
    at the University of TÃ¼bingen.

    The tracks of vessels from the ICOADS database.
    I made it to illustrate how rich metadata alone can be as a source for historical research:
    it&#8217;s also just an interesting way to see the continents through large-scale patterns
    of behavior. Several people asked for higher-resolution versions; I recreated a few dozen
    charts on the same concept [here](http://flickr.com/photos/10052187@N05)

    This portion of [*Creating Data*](http://creatingdata.us) presents a
    new way to look at the digital library: a visual bibliography as a
    15-million book zoomable scatterplot, displaying a variety of metadata
    and allowing you to click through to the Hathi Trust.

- title: 'Gendered Language in Teaching Evaluations'
  description: |
    An interactive exploration of the different language used to describe
    professors in multiple fields. As well as my explanation off the page,
    the writeups in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/upshot/is-the-professor-bossy-or-brilliant-much-depends-on-gender.html)
    and [The Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/how-reviews-on-rate-my-professors-describe-men-and-women-differently/93687)
    using the D3 interface to Bookworm.

  description: |
    One point per person in the US for the 2010 and 2020 censuses, fully zoomable
    and interactive using WebGL and [Deepscatter](https://github.com/CreatingData/deepscatter).
    Since this uses WebGL individual point rendering and quadtiled data, it can be far
    more responsive than raster-based maps you may have seen in 2010. Plus, if you zoom all
    the way in in some views it has little person glyphs!

    This is less a data visualization than a primitive for making them. If you've never heard of the Hilbert Curve,
    there's nothing you'll care to see here. But [Job van der Zwan](https://observablehq.com/@jobleonard/a-simple-algorithm-to-generate-h-curves?collection=@jobleonard/space-filling-curves)
    and [Martin Wattenberg](http://hint.fm/papers/158-wattenberg-final3.pdf) have done interesting things with the
    under-appreciated H-Curve, and there's a lot more could be done. Plus it's fun to watch the animation.
- title: "Data Driven Projections: Darwin's World"
  description: |
    The hard part of this is Philippe Riviere's extraordinary work creating something called the Voronoi Projection.
    I noticed, though, that enables what I call 'Data Driven Projections,'
    map representations of the world
    customized for any set of points. The one below shows the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s, 
    with Darwin; you can change the observable notebook at
    [this link](https://beta.observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/data-driven-projections-darwins-world) for any dataset you like.

Made using QGIS, Leaflet, and some command-line GDAL tools with maps and data from the transit authorities and tiles from Open Street Map.'
