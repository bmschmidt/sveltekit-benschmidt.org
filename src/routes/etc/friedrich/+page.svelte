of modern communications control The importance of a thorough
understanding of how communcaitions work was shows by indicating
recurrent breakdowns in policy enforcement, due to faulty
communications. The vital role of communications in the
administrative process is only one aspect of their over-all
siginfiicance in a democracy. The shaping of public opinion is
dependent upon effective competition in the market place [sic] which
mass communication provides. Hence problems of monopoly and other
types of combination formed an important part of the discussions,
especially in connection with the study of the radio… Because of
its special interest to members of the school, and its importance at
the present time, the public relations activities of government
agencies received specail [sic] attention.”

<h4 class="western">(a)Memo saying there’s a need for a study on
different grounds:</h4>
<h5 class="western">(i)“Theoretical: The political and social
scientist needsto know how radio pbroadcasting functions in forming
opinion in our political and social system. He also needs to know how
the control of radiobroadcasting has affected the general
distritbtion of controls in modern society.”</h5>
<h5 class="western">(ii)“Practical: Educators, labour leaders,
philanthropists, and others who wish to ‘improve’ American radio,
could be more effective, if their approach were more realistic. Many
proposals are being made at the present time, such as government
broadcasting stations should be erected, without any apparent
realization on the part of theose making them, as to the practical
problems involved.” 
</h5>
<h5 class="western">(iii)“Practical: With the task of national
mobilization looming on the horizon, the issue of a satisfactory,
workable pattern of control relationships for radiobroadcasting
presents itself as an urgent concern, calling for immediate
attention. Yet the lack of any real understanding and knowledge of
the patterns of control in peace time Is a serious obstacle to
effective action in this field.”

entirely as an amateur. I am not a psychologist. I am not a radio
expert. I have made no surveys. But for some time, I have thought
that advertising directly connected with news reports and news
comment was having a bad effect upon public opinion and public
attitude, and I have talked with a good many people about the subject
and found a good bit of opinion on my side.”  He’s a historian.</h4>
<h5 class="western">(i)Advertising as a tool of the enemy. “I take
it that it is very much to the interest of the enemy that Americans
go on doing things in their usual way. Business-as-usual seems to be

a highly efficient, highly organized war economy….”

me to make it difficult for those who might have something to

<h5 class="western">(ii)2/14/41 CJF responds. “When I said that
‘the conclusions might carry more conviction if presented by
someone other than the parties at interest,’  I did not intend to
suggest or make the assertion ‘no one can have an honest point of
view if he is definitely involved in and experienced with something’
Are you not a bit hypersensitive here? The remark in the first
instance covers the public official as well as the industry.…&nbsp;I
our several conversation I thought it was readily apparent and agreed
to that considerable acerbity existed between public officials and
people in tehindustry. My judgment may be wrong but having observed a
good many situtation of this kind I would be inclined to feel that
proposals by either group are apt to be considered with suspicion by
the other party. Tiwas, as youknow, my hope that an outsider might
fruitfully attempt to suggest a new approach since the problem of
radiobroadcasting in wartime is of such great importance to the
country as a whole. IT is still my hoope, although I am afraid it
isgetting almost too late. I am more fearful every day that snap
jugments will decide these crucial issues in the event of a crisis.”

listener, or the techniques tto be used in reaching him. While these
studies are of importance in an understanding of the role of radio in
the lives of people, and therefore enabling the radio expert to make
osme sort of plan for his broadcasting output, they are unrealistic
in approaching the problem in a vacuum. It is of only a little use to
know how people react to agiven program when we do not know how such
programs are put on the air, how they originate, and why they are
produced. The listener and why h e reacts as he does is only one half
of the picture; the broadcaster and why he acts as he does is equally
important in any evaluation of the role of radio in modern life.”</h5>
