	<p>Radio Reception and Theories of Society:</p>
	<p>The Rise and Fall of Communications Research, 1936–1943</p>

	<h1 id="introduction">Intlroduction</h1>
	<p>
		Among the many effects of the rise of new electronic media on American life was a newly rigorous
		focus on the concept of communication itself. A new type of mass media and mass culture,
		embodied above in the swift establishment of radio as a central element in the day-to-day life
		of most Americans and Europeans, drove social scientists to conceptualize “communications” as,
		for the first time, a distinct field of study in the human sciences. But though it was clear
		that ‘communications’ represented an important aspect of social life, no one knew exactly how to
		explore it. As a result, communications studies became, in its early years, an incubator of
		diverse perspectives from throughout the social sciences and humanities. For some it seemed that
		a fully articulated field of communications would encompass a new theory of society as whole.
	</p>
	<p>
		How this field formed, and how it functioned in its early years, is an important and largely
		overlooked facet in the evolution of the American social sciences in the period before the
		Second World War. Never definitively enshrined as a peer of older fields like sociology,
		economics, or anthropology in the universities, communications plays only a passing role in
		studies of the social sciences during the interwar period as a whole. Histories of the field
		written by modern communications researchers, on the other hand, largely treat the early history
		of the field in relation to present conflicts within the discipline, ignoring other important
		elements of its early development. The opening statement in one recent history that
		communications “crystallized into a distinct discipline within sociology—complete with colleges,
		curricula, the authority to grant doctorates, and so forth—between about 1950 and 1955”<a
			href="#fn1"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref1"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a
		>
		is only an extreme example of the disregard most writers have for the flourishing field of communications
		in the late 1930s and 1940s. As a result, both sides in the major division in the history of the
		field—between advocates of a “received history” advocating a linear narrative of scientific progress,
		and critics of the “dominant paradigm” who seek to integrate voices from the past outside the academic
		discipline who anticipated a more critical perspective towards society and the media (generally,
		a perspective shared by the writers themselves)—ignore the prewar research that did not directly
		feed into later lines of research in communications.
		<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
	</p>
	<p>
		This disciplinary perspective is particularly stifling because early communications research is
		characterized, above all, by its interdisciplinary. From the mid-1930s into the war,
		communications functioned as an important site for the exchange of ideas, techniques, and
		individuals not only among the social sciences, but with the government and the broadcasting and
		advertising industries as well. The novelty of the research problems brought together
		individuals who would later scatter into the security of more isolated, homogenous enterprises
		in academics and business. For a brief period, advertisers felt that that they needed
		psychologists to understand how to market their products; broadcasters felt that they needed
		academic statisticians to help them analyze their listenership patterns; and researchers felt
		that they needed corporate and government funding and data to produce studies of the scope that
		the new medium demanded. Until the increasingly utilitarian needs of the war effort came to
		restrict the scope of research, the flexibility of approaches in the field meant that
		communications played an important part in the incorporation of new ideas across disciplinary
		and professional boundaries.
	</p>
	<p>
		As many writers have noted, the federal government played a critical role in the early evolution
		of communications research, particularly in the important subfield of propaganda.<a
			href="#fn3"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref3"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a
		> But particularly in the period before the war, two other sets of institutions played an even greater
		role in spurring new academic research. The first were corporations involved in publishing and broadcasting,
		who looked to academic research to help identify their audience and increase their profits, above
		all through a better understanding of advertising. Second, nonprofit foundations and universities
		predated the government in their support for research into the effects of new mass communications
		agencies, and so ensured that substantial resources were available even for studies that did not
		strictly align with corporate interests.
	</p>
	<p>
		The result of these forces was a fresh field of study, with low barriers to entry, a socially
		relevant subject matter, and no single methodological orientation powerful enough to exclude
		other approaches. As a result, the study of communications briefly attracted leading scholars
		and rising stars from across the social sciences. Among the most prominent were psychologists
		like Kurt Lewin and Carl Hovland, sociologists including Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert Merton, and
		political scientists such as Harold Lasswell and Carl Joachim Friedrich. Equally impressive is
		the quality of scholars who worked in the field but were temperamentally and ideologically
		leagues away from the functionalist, quantitative model that came to dominate communications
		research. Attracted by the possibility of analyzing the massive changes in research brought
		about by the new media, soon-to-be major social critics including C. Wright Mills, Theodor
		Adorno, and David Riesman all worked in the field in its early days. And early communications
		researchers achieved great success in the business world, as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although, as critics of the field have argued, the eventual orientation of communications was
		behavioristic and quantitative, this early history of the discipline is not a straightforward
		emergence out of the more empirical branches of the existing social sciences. Nor is its later
		history simple an account of the academic field of communications through the decades. Indeed,
		the communications research of the late 1930s and early 1940s should not be viewed exclusively
		as antecedent to the modern academic field with the same name. Historians of science sometimes
		like to look at the roads not taken in the evolution of a science; but in the case of
		communications research, many of them <em>were</em> in fact taken, but by corporate researchers or
		sociologists or others outside the confines of the present-day field. During the war, many of the
		leading figures in communications left the field, and the postwar field lacked some of the brilliant
		diversity that characterized its first methodological flowering. The greatest importance of early
		communications studies lies in its role as a site of exchange among corporations, government officials,
		and the various social sciences; this is the network of relations that this paper explores.
	</p>
	<p>
		The origins of this community lie in a small group of organizations that together constituted
		the core of the first group to identify themselves as communications researchers. Most were
		centered around New York City, which was home to the major radio networks, the primary funder of
		research in the Rockefeller foundation, and the most important research project, at Columbia
		University. The time frame is relatively narrow as well; this story primarily covers the period
		from 1936, when the Rockefeller Foundation began to seriously consider the need for a new type
		of research on the mass media, until 1943, when the increasing subordination of new research to
		the war aims of the government ended the early period of diverse methodological approaches.

		The christening of communications did not take place until 1939. John Marshall, the assistant
		director of the Division of Humanities at the Rockefeller foundation, wrote that summer to
		researchers in “a field which for a lack of a better name I have come to call mass
		communications.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>4</sup></a
		> By the time he felt the need to put the field on a new footing, research into the “mass media of
		communication” (the first two words of the phrase were not yet familiar enough to stand on their
		own) had been going on for some time. But only in the 1930s did that research come to collectively
		take place far enough from the media corporations to be seen as a single unitary field. Marshall
		and the Rockefeller foundation were critical in effecting that change; and so, the genesis of communications
		research lies in large part in their efforts to unify the various inquiries into media and society
		already underway.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the first half of the decade, substantive research about the radio had been primarily driven
		by the needs of the rapidly expanding ranks of broadcasters. Although commercial broadcasts
		began only in 1920, in 1930 radios were already more common household items than either
		telephones or newspaper subscriptions. By 1940, a radio receiver sat in four out of every five
		American homes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>5</sup></a
		> As a commercial structure evolved that relied on advertisements as the sole source of revenues,
		two questions in particular demanded new research techniques. The first was the question of the radio
		audience: since radio executives had no figure comparable to newspaper circulation to show their
		advertisers, to convince advertisers to sponsor programs they needed to find a different way of estimating
		the number who listened to them. A second question, less unique to radio, lay in measuring the efficacy
		of advertising and seeing what sorts of advertisements had the greatest impact.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though the former sort of question was most easily pursued via survey research and the latter
		through laboratory research in applied psychology, in practice the same investigators often
		answered both of them. The career of Frank Stanton, who emerged out NBC’s research department to
		head the network in the mid-1940s, is indicative in this regard. As a graduate student in
		psychology at Ohio State University, Stanton initially investigated the effectiveness of
		advertising in various media, through a series of tests testing how well people remembered key
		phrases and brand names from advertising copy that they either saw printed on the page or heard
		read aloud.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
		For his doctoral dissertation, however, he turned to the problem of audience research. Unconvinced
		of the accuracy of existing survey techniques in measuring the radio audience, he built a number
		of toaster-sized devices that registered if a radio was turned on or off. After installing them in
		a number of homes, he compared the self-reported listening habits of the subjects gathered through
		traditional survey techniques with the data logged by the machines.<a
			href="#fn7"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref7"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a
		>
		By Stanton’s account, the ideology underlying the device was his “Ohio State behaviorism”: since
		radio listening, not memory of listening, was the relevant variable, he set out to design a device
		which would measure the physical fact of the receiver’s activity and nothing else. Fittingly enough,
		the immediate technical inspiration for his test of listener honesty was the stylus-paper arrangement
		that records physiological reactions in a polygraph machine.<a
			href="#fn8"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref8"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		While the psychologists were carried on this and similar investigations into the nature of
		radio, educators were also growing increasingly interested in the medium as they sought to
		create educational programming, build university radio stations, and schedule regular broadcasts
		of lectures. Even more than the networks, though, the educational institutions felt the need for
		specific information about their audience and the effects of their broadcasts. While network
		broadcasters were generally content to know simply their raw number of listeners, educational
		and cultural broadcasters were more particularly concerned to learn who was listening to their
		programs. Did the lectures that many university radio stations sent over the airwaves create a
		new audience for their subjects, or were their listeners the same people who already frequented
		the lecture halls? What (if anything) did listeners take away after listening to broadcasts by
		educational shortwave stations such as W1XAL in Boston? And how could listeners be induced to
		tune in these sorts of broadcasts instead of the light music and serial dramas that dominated
		the airwaves?
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only the educational broadcasters wanted the answers to these questions; their underwriters,
		too, wanted to see tangible support for the high-flying hopes many educators placed in radio for
		the dissemination of culture and knowledge. On the other hand, networks, with a comfortable rate
		structure in place for advertisements, had no need to delve further into the data. As one
		contemporary put it, “Business is so ‘good’ in broadcasting that the industry is not inclined to
		spend money for research until they are forced to do so, not only because of the embarrassment
		such data might cause, but because business does not demand it.”<a
			href="#fn9"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref9"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		As funders like Marshall at the Rockefeller Foundation realized, a substantial investment in
		research to answer these questions would not only help increase an abstract understanding of the
		workings of the radio; it would also be invaluable in active efforts to increase the quality of
		broadcast programming. What kind of research, though, would it take? Studies of the audience
		could build off of existing survey techniques like those used in the Crossley ratings of radio
		broadcasts (the predecessor to the modern Nielsen television ratings); but more detailed
		demographic data would require a large, independent research infrastructure, presumably using
		the sampling techniques being developed for the new polling companies. Likewise, psychological
		studies of advertising effects could provide only a starting point for questions about the
		effects of programming in the long run, and indeed of radio listening in general. Thus, even as
		they strove to answer new empirical questions, educators and funders contemplating further
		research found themselves confronting new methodological questions as well. Precise answers to
		these methodological questions would only emerge once research had actually begun, as projects
		began to spin off new questions of their own and as researchers from different fields began to
		discover both what questions they shared and what important subjects none of them studied. It
		was in the course of this research that what had been thought of simply as “radio research”
		began to frame its questions and approaches in terms of a larger problematic: mass
		communications.
	</p>
	<h2 id="lazarsfelds-bureau">Lazarsfeld’s Bureau</h2>
	<p>
		From its founding in 1936, the Princeton Radio Research Project would be the most important site
		where these questions were developed. Marshall received the initial proposal from Princeton
		psychologist Hadley Cantril, whose <em>The Psychology of Radio</em> struck him “as an almost
		heaven-sent indication of an interest in work of this kind” and Frank Stanton, who had by then
		parlayed his Ph.D. in psychology into a job in NBC’s tiny research office.<a
			href="#fn10"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref10"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a
		>
		They laid out an ambitious plan not just to conduct studies of the social impact of radio, but also,
		through the development of new methods, to determine “what constitutes the field of radio research”
		at all.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> As
		the occupations of its directors suggested, it would build on existing research in both the academy
		and the industry; but in trying to describe the “social significance of radio,” they would move far
		beyond either the individual-oriented psychological studies or the raw commercial statistics collated
		by the networks.
	</p>
	<p>
		No sooner had Marshall authorized a substantial Rockefeller grant in support of the
		project—$67,000 over three years from September 1937—than both Cantril and Stanton begged out of
		the immediate responsibility of running the project. Cantril was already struggling under his
		workload as a newly tenured professor at Princeton and an editor at the <em
			>Public Opinion Quarterly</em
		>, and CBS enticed Stanton, who had been supposed to direct the day-to-day activities of the
		project, to remain full time at the network with a substantial raise and a promotion to director
		of research. Over the summer of 1937 they frantically consulted a series of advisors, including
		the pollster George Gallup and the sociologist Robert Lynd, possible replacements to shape the
		project. All the leading players came to agree that Paul Lazarsfeld, an Austrian social
		scientist who was trying to establish himself in the United States, would be the best choice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although Lazarsfeld made his name in America as a professor of sociology, those who knew him in
		his first years in the United States thought of him more as a market researcher or social
		psychologist. By training, he was actually a mathematician, but Lazarsfeld had been able to
		switch to work in psychology—at the influential Viennese institute of Karl and Charlotte
		Bühler—largely because his mathematical expertise let him the lead in social psychological
		investigations involving the analysis of data. In Vienna, he had founded the
		Wirtschaftspsychologische Forschungsstelle [economic-psychologicall research center], which
		organized researchers to develop advanced techniques to engage in contract research for anyone
		who bid for their services. Lazarsfeld, who had earlier been active in the Viennese socialist
		movement, happily engaged in studies of topics such as the psychology of shoe purchasing and the
		factors influencing consumption of tea. The center was, a contemporary later recalled, “a
		midpoint between an institute for market research… and a university institute for social
		research.”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
		Among these myriad research was one of particular note to the Princeton directors: the first quantitative
		study ever made of radio listening habits from a social-psychological perspective, which Lazarsfeld
		completed in 1932.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>13</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Lazarsfeld’s myriad, and nearly contradictory roles in Austria—market researcher, quantitative
		sociologist, socialist activist, and Viennese psychologist—would all have their influence on the
		Radio Project, and all represent important strands of early communications research.<a
			href="#fn14"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref14"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a
		> The two former roles, however, were the most important in the project’s early years. Thanks to
		Rockefeller funding and its Princeton affiliation, the Radio Project was independent of the networks
		insofar as it could pursue research without having to worry either about its profitability or, for
		the most part, whether its findings would be embarrassing to the industry. But since the most extensive
		data on radio listening was held by the networks, and since the radio researchers didn’t want to
		forswear the help of experienced researchers and broadcasters like Stanton himself, they retained
		strong connections to corporate needs in their research. As a result, even as ‘radio researchers’
		sought to invent techniques that would help educational broadcasters or that might criticize the
		existing broadcasting system, they had a strong incentive to work at the same time on projects that
		would pique the industry’s interest. Thus, the Radio Project often acted as a testing ground for
		advanced techniques that the networks were unwilling to engage in themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		This catholic approach to research problems grew out of Lazarsfeld’s own research style. He saw
		himself as, first and foremost, an expert in the techniques of research; the topic to be studied
		was of secondary importance. For this reason, he was willing to take on topics that had little
		intrinsic interest as social science, as evinced most of all in the marketing research he
		undertook both in Vienna and in New York.<a
			href="#fn15"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref15"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a
		>
		Thus, even the Office of Radio Research itself was often engaged in studies only tangentially, at
		best, related to the radio. For example, in his eagerness to sharpen his office’s facility testing
		and administering questionnaires, Lazarsfeld helped develop an early version of the Cosmopolitan
		magazine quiz: the ORR produced a report for the magazine testing the reliability of a survey to
		be administered by a friend on the topic “Are you an overspender?” But the immensity of the corporate
		operations also presented tremendous opportunity for Lazarsfeld to obtain new data sets to work with,
		and to fund new investigations: as he put it, “This field of radio research presents three important
		opportunities to psychologists: challenging problems, unusual data, and more jobs.”<a
			href="#fn16"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref16"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the project’s most lasting creations shows the ways that ‘radio research’ itself came to
		serve as a locus for the transition of research techniques from applied psychology to corporate
		use, much as Frank Stanton had done with his work in graduate school on listening behavior. The
		Lazarsfeld-Stanton program analyzer (institutional loyalty led to it being called the
		Stanton-Lazarsfeld program analyzer at CBS) used the same sort of mechanical arrangement as
		Stanton’s dissertation project—a marker inscribing results over time on a moving strip of
		paper—but with a technique less heavily grounded in behavioristic ideas. Rather than registering
		whether a radio receiver was turned on or off, the program analyzer registered if the listener
		was pushing one of two buttons. A green button indicated approval of what he or she was hearing;
		a red one, disapproval. Researchers would use this record to guide an interview of the subject
		to investigate what properties of the program had caused the reaction.<a
			href="#fn17"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref17"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a
		>
		The researchers rapidly applied the program analyzer to a number of studies involving the effect
		of broadcasts on listeners, and proclaimed its virtues in <em>Radio Research 1942–1943.</em> But
		its use as a tool of rigorous research was limited, as well as its suitability for meaningful
		evaluations of educational broadcasts. A later attempt to use a slightly more complicated
		version of the same idea as a tool for classroom teaching shows the difficulty. The researchers
		went through several evaluative pairs to correspond to the red and green buttons (including
		understand/don’t understand; interesting/uninteresting; important/unimportant) before finding
		that the only couplet that produced consistent results was “I am getting what I want/I am not
		getting what I want.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>18</sup></a
		> The result neatly sums up the successes and failures of the device. It produces feedback that cannot
		easily guide improvement in the tester’s goals; it only enables him or her to react to the immediate
		wants of the person being tested.
	</p>
	<p>
		This reliance on the irreducible feelings of the experimental subject, although it crippled the
		program analyzer’s usefulness in academics, proved to be perfectly suited to the networks’
		needs. By allowing the quantification of preferences on programs, the program analyzer filled an
		analogous need to that served by ratings—executives were finally able, without the expense of
		broadcasting and Crossleys, to predict which shows would be successful on the air. Stanton
		immediately began using it in his research department at CBS, and the advertising firm
		McCann-Erickson paid a regular royalty from 1943 for the “exclusive” use of the machine
		(although it was not patentable, and others would use it).<a
			href="#fn19"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref19"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a
		>
		Like much communications research, this corporate tool also found itself swept up in the war effort—specifically,
		in work done as part of Samuel Stouffer’s massive project to study the attitudes of the American
		military. Stouffer (himself an alumnus of the radio project) assigned Yale psychologist Carl Hovland
		to help test the efficacy of Frank Capra’s propaganda films “Why We Fight.” Hovland contracted Lazarsfeld’s
		ORR to run assessments of Capra’s film, and one of the most recent additions to Columbia’s faculty,
		Robert K. Merton, directed the study. The accuracy of the device allowed Merton to confront the filmmakers
		decisions: “Even though Frank Capra thought he was reaching hoi polloi, these kids didn’t know what
		he was talking about,” Merton later recalled.<a
			href="#fn20"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref20"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a
		> More recently, the usefulness of the device in helping to shape popular entertainment and propaganda
		has helped win it a position as an essential element in the arsenal of the modern campaign manager
		and pollster.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other studies began as outright collaborations, rather than gradually finding their way into
		corporate and government applications as did the program analyzer. For example, researchers
		realized that although the CAB rating data included information on socioeconomic status of the
		respondents,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>21</sup></a
		>
		both the surveyors and the networks used the rating data only to create raw listenership numbers.
		The project’s directors contracted NBC research director H.M. Beville to investigate the possible
		further applications of this data, with the stated aim “to acquaint a larger public, presumably one
		interested in educational broadcasting, with the vast fund of material which commercial agencies
		have been collecting for years and which is quite astounding as to amount and regularity of canvass.”<a
			href="#fn22"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref22"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a
		>
		Lazarsfeld’s Austrian experience clearly imprinted itself on the study’s conception. Above all, the
		devoted attention to social class reflects the lingering political ambition in Lazarsfeld’s early
		work to show the distinctive features of the “proletarian buying public.” (Indeed, some have found
		this attention to class the only noticeable income of his early leftism on Lazarsfeld’s later research.)<a
			href="#fn23"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref23"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		But while Beville’s study did manage to squeeze a great deal more information out of the
		existing Crossley numbers than had previously been attempted, the benefits again redounded
		chiefly to the commercial community. The data that Beville analyzed were available only to the
		advertisers, agencies and networks which subscribed to the Crossley reports. While the report’s
		conclusions were not without interest for the educational community (they included, for
		instance, data about cultural programming like the General Motors symphony hour), they were
		severely limited by the fact that Crossley numbers included only commercial programs; neither
		smaller educational broadcasters, nor the networks own unsponsored “sustaining” broadcasts were
		included. Thus, as with the program analyzer, the research efforts of the Radio Project brought
		new techniques to bear on problems that the networks themselves had regarded as unimportant, but
		more to the benefit of the networks than to the research community. Lazarsfeld proudly reported
		to the Rockefeller foundation that Beville had told him “NBC really ought to have paid him for
		doing this job because by doing it, he learned how much more this contained than he or any of
		his colleagues had ever before suspected.”<a
			href="#fn24"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref24"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a
		>
		Advertisers, too, stood to gain from such research. When the time came to market the second collection
		of project essays, the circular promoting the book read “Every advertiser, every agencyman knows
		the names Paul F. Lazarsfled and Frank Stanton. Lazarsfeld is Director, Office of Radio Research,
		Columbia University and Stanton is v. p., CBS. Together they have compiled a book which will be of
		<span class="underline">great value to advertisers.</span>
		The book is:
		<em>Radio Research 1942–43.</em>”<a
			href="#fn25"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref25"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		While these commercial applications represent a crucial part of the early work in radio
		research, they nonetheless formed an essential part of a research model that helped establish
		communications as an independent field. As the use of socioeconomic analysis in the Beville
		study suggests, not all these advances could be traced back to origins using the sort of
		psychological equipment that was epitomized in the program analyzer. This insistence on
		integrating a wider social perspective in its work is one of the central developments that made
		the new communications research fundamentally different from the sorts of studies that had come
		before. The dynamics of this shift were already evident even before Lazarsfeld arrived: by
		asking Robert Lynd for advice on the new director of their project, Cantril and Stanton were
		implicitly admitting that the psychological techniques they used could only go so far in
		illuminating “the social situation of radio.” But it was in the persons of Lazarsfeld and Lynd
		that the research began to actually engage with these new problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just how closely communications research looked to sociology as a model is evident in the
		field’s relationship with the Columbia sociologist Robert Lynd. Lynd’s immensely popular study <em
			>Middletown,</em
		>
		co-written with his wife Helen, served as a dominant model for the sort of work early communications
		researchers hoped to undertake. They hoped to expand on his exploration of the ways changing American
		values, particularly increasing capitalist acquisitiveness, had disrupted traditional patterns of
		American life. Likewise, they wanted to be able to look at the impact of new communications technologies
		on typical American communities, not just individuals, and to be able to offer holistic sociological
		descriptions of those communities in the same way that Lynd had transformed Muncie, Indiana into
		an archetypal “Middletown.” Moreover, <em>Middletown</em>
		itself presented a model investigation of modern mass society in a way few other studies could. The
		Lynds did not fully explore the role of media and communications in Muncie’s civic life; but it was
		easy for communications researchers to present their work as adding that new dimension to complete
		the picture of mass society that Lynd had begun. Accordingly, Leo Rosten introduced his Motion Picture
		Research Project to the readers of the <em>Public Opinion Quarterly</em> as “A ‘Middletown’
		Study of Hollywood,”<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>26</sup></a
		>
		and Paul Lazarsfeld’s study of voting patterns in Sandusky, Ohio seems to have evolved out of an
		initial plan to select “a kind of radio ‘Middletown’ to which we can refer whenever needed.”<a
			href="#fn27"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref27"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Moreover, although Lynd did not himself direct any studies of mass communications, his post-<em
			>Middletown</em
		>
		renown as a professor at Columbia, allowed him to serve as a senior statesman lending credibility
		and guidance to the nascent field. Lynd initially sponsored Lazarsfeld’s first trips to the United
		States under a Rockefeller grant, suggested Lazarsfeld as a likely head of the Princeton Radio Research
		Project, and later saw that his Office of Radio Research found a home at Columbia; Lynd sat on the
		advisory board to Rosten’s study of Hollywood and joined John Marshall’s seminar on Communications
		at the Rockefeller Foundation. Even so, he remained something of an outsider—as he wrote John Marshall
		at the Rockefeller Foundation, “I am interested in the field of communication and regard it as very
		important. But the doggone thing just isn’t something in which I have either central interest or
		special competence.”<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>28</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		While Lynd was willing to remain an outsider, albeit a very influential one, others saw in radio
		a new way to make their careers the same way Lynd had made his with <em>Middletown.</em> Thus, the
		Radio Project pursued studies that rather than looking at radio’s effect on the individual level,
		attempted to see its effects on a community as a whole, using the tools of social psychology, anthropology,
		and sociology in similar ways to Lynd. Such community-oriented studies became increasingly important
		as the political crisis in Europe grew. Especially since the world of research was full of European
		émigrés, expectations were high that America too would quickly become involved. As a result, the
		public hysteria that broke out after Orson Welles’ Mercury Radio Theater broadcast their famous “War
		of the Worlds” adaptation appeared an indispensable opportunity to explore the ways that the new
		medium functioned in disseminating information and panic in a crisis situation. Hadley Cantril and
		Herta Herzog (who, in Princeton, was just a few miles from the site of the alien landing and therefore
		ideally located to study its effects) directed what Lazarsfeld called a “Firehouse study” to quickly
		interview dozens of individuals who had heard the broadcast, and to speculate about both the psychological
		and sociological causes that made certain individuals and communities more susceptible to panic.
	</p>
	<p>
		A more widely anticipated event, the 1940 presidential election, afforded Lazarsfeld an
		opportunity to conduct a “Middletown” study of his own. Although he had initially hoped to
		conduct a panel study of radio listening, the final work (still done under the auspices of the
		ORR) studied the forces influencing voter behavior. The published study, <em
			>The People’s Choice,</em
		> was widely influential in political science as the first study to focus in depth on a single group
		of voters, and thus to be able to determine when and why they changed their minds. In communications
		research it played an important role in structuring the way that researchers thought of information
		as diffusing through society, introducing the idea of the “two-step flow” which has since become
		a staple of the communications curriculum. According to the theory, media events do not have an instant
		and predictable effect on each individual listener in isolation (called the “hypodermic needle” model);
		instead, opinions and information tend to diffuse from the media into a few key members of the community
		(“opinion leaders”) who, through personal interactions, tend to guide others in the community in
		forming their own opinions.
	</p>
	<p>
		This theory, once accepted, cemented an element of the sociological perspective as a new
		orthodoxy in the field. If media effects diffused through a community rather than acting on an
		individual, psychological experiments or even focus group panels would be inadequate to capture
		their effects. Furthermore, the idea of the two-step flow was crucial in consolidating
		communications research as a field, by seeing bringing together electronic and print media with
		interpersonal conservations as a single object of study. Similar ORR studies relying on these
		insights found wide diffusion in the print media, in academic organs like the <em
			>Journal of Applied Psychology,</em
		>
		and eventually the ORR’s own <em>Radio Research</em> and <em>Communications Research</em> publications.
		As a result, by 1940, the Office of Radio Research had already brought the mainstream of the field
		into an understanding of the role of communications in society that went far beyond its origins in
		corporate research, into a theory of the new dynamics of society the pervasive electronic media was
		creating.
	</p>
	<p>
		This theory was by no means intrinsically radical. Indeed, certain features of Lazarsfeld’s
		approach, like its top-down model of dissemination and its focus on discrete, measurable changes
		in opinion rather than the more pervasive ways the media might shape society, have led some more
		recent media theorists to consider the ORR research politically regressive. But even in its
		origins from Lynd’s <em>Middletown</em> studies—which contained, beneath their insistence on
		scientific objectivity, a committed progressive stance<a
			href="#fn29"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref29"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a
		>—communications research contained a good deal of heavily critical potential. Cantril, Stanton,
		and Marshall’s choice of a socialist Austrian political refugee in Lazarsfeld to head the
		project further shows the field’s willingness, at the time of its birth, to criticize
		fundamentally the government and corporate arrangements that controlled key channels of
		communication. Those Lazarsfeld hired for the project often did so. Many were, like Lazarsfeld,
		European émigrés whose position left them eager for work. And because of the political climate
		in Europe, the scholars most eager to leave often held positions far more radical than
		Lazarsfeld’s own. Despite these views, however, and thanks to the extraordinary methodological
		fluidity of the early work, communications research proved an important vector for their
		incorporation into American society. Their incorporation, in turn, helped communications become
		of the most important routes through which European currents in psychology and social thought,
		particularly Marxist and Freudian theories, entered into American social science.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most famous of these encounters was the tenure of Theodor Adorno as the director of musical
		research at the Radio Project. Adorno’s experience in New York is often summarily dismissed as a
		failed experiment, with scant publications and no immediate impact.<a
			href="#fn30"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref30"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a
		>
		But although few of works found immediate publication, primarily because John Marshall cut Rockefeller
		funding to his projects before they could be completed, Lazarsfeld’s relationship with Adorno and
		with the other members of the <em>Institut fur Sozialforschung</em> in exile in New York was
		actually quite productive. Lazarsfeld himself, despite an occasionally strained personal
		relationship, was a passionate advocate of the value of Adorno’s work to the Rockefeller
		Foundation and others, going so far as to invite a number of guests from the foundation and from
		the networks to attend Adorno’s staff presentation of his work at the Office of Radio Research,
		an unprecedented move. The eventual removal of Adorno from the Office’s payroll came only over
		his repeated objection. Moreover, he continued to work closely with other members of the
		Frankfurt School: Leo Lowenthal drew on a few of the lessons of content analysis for an article
		on biographies in popular magazines in the 1942-43 issue of radio research, and the official
		organ of the Institute, <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>, handed its reins to
		Lazarsfeld for an entire issue devoted to the social criticism of radio research.
	</p>
	<p>
		In many respects, Lazarsfeld’s program was not really so far from that of the Frankfurt School.
		Although the sociologist’s Marxism seems to have nearly disappeared after he arrived in the
		United States (aside from his continuing attention to the importance of class distinctions), he
		persisted in questioning the role radio played in society. A letter to Robert Lynd after Adorno
		left the project reveals the depths of his suspicions about the new medium:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			However, this new idea of two-way communication now clouds one very important aspect of
			communication research, and that is the study of what radio (chosen as an example) does to
			people unintentionally. Here really the whole Adorno aspect would have to come in. In ‘Radio
			and the Printed page,’ for instance, at the end of the sixth chapter I have outlined why radio
			would always reinforces conservative, middle-class mores. It always shies away from any
			discussion of really controversial matters, that is to say all controversies except those
			between the Republicans and Democratics [sic]. It tremendously increases authoritarian
			patterns by continually playing up the biggest band leaders, the best soap, the greatest song
			hit, the most famous actor, and so on. It also impoverishes the little bit of variety we have
			in our leisure-time activities by forcing us to take what we get instead of getting what we
			want. The tremendous amount of popular music provides steady sources of escape.<a
				href="#fn31"
				class="footnote-ref"
				id="fnref31"
				role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a
			>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Like Adorno, Lazarsfeld saw authoritarian tendencies reinforced by the new entertainment
		industries; and like them, he sought an explanation in the psychic needs of the individual. The
		chief difference was that Lazarsfeld saw this perspective as only one useful front in the larger
		struggle to define a field of radio research; the critical theorists could not warm to tasks
		such as using the program analyzer to determine the quality of new shows, because they saw the
		individual tastes as being too warped by current radio practice to be of much use. But while he
		was unwilling to curtail his studies to the extent Adorno might have liked, Lazarsfeld remained
		enthusiastic about the contribution that a “European perspective” of critical Marxism could have
		in the understanding of radio.
	</p>
	<p>
		The anti-corporate elements of the Marxist critiques fell on predictably unreceptive ears from
		many of the industry-associated individuals who worked with the project. One wrote to the
		Rockefeller Foundation condemning Adorno’s talk as “hardly worthy of serious consideration,
		except possibly as propaganda. In short, it seems to have an axiom to grind.”<a
			href="#fn32"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref32"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a
		>
		But it was not conservative resistance that ultimately drove the critical theorists from the field;
		rather, it was the ameliorative goals of those who thought radio research should help purge the worst
		excesses from corporate radio. Thus, in Adorno’s case, the final act took the form of a classic struggle
		between revolutionaries and reformers. In a memorandum explaining why he had cut funding for Adorno
		over Lazarsfeld’s objections, John Marshall wrote that Adorno “seems psychologically engaged at the
		moment by his ability to recognize deficiencies in the broadcasting of music to an extent that makes
		questionable his own drive to find ways of remedying them.”<a
			href="#fn33"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref33"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a
		> Robert Lynd, the most vocal proponent among the Rockefeller group of taking advantage of the national
		emergency to consolidate greater governmental control of the radio infrastructure, agreed with Marshall:
		Adorno was too unable to make allies within the system to be a useful critic from outside it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Psychoanalysis presented fewer political problems, and Lazarsfeld aimed from the beginning to
		incorporate it into radio research. One of his first actions as director of the project was to
		pay a group of psychoanalysts to discuss topics like the nature of the entertainment derived
		from different sorts of radio broadcasts. Indeed, Lazarsfeld’s connection to the world of
		Freudian psychology was so strong that Frank Stanton himself mistakenly remembered a number of
		years later that Lazarsfeld had been trained by Freud. At the most basic level, the Freudian
		influences that pervaded the project served as a corrective to the ascendant behavioralist
		trends in American psychology. Frank Stanton, as the product of that school, often found himself
		raging against the constant intrusions into the project’s research of the Freudian idea of the
		unconscious. In this sense, the Freudianism of the Radio Project can even be thought of as
		further evidence of its sociological turn, for in the late 1930s Freud’s influence was stronger
		in that field than in the behaviorist psychological circles that fed into much radio research.<a
			href="#fn34"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref34"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a
		>
		The most important transformation of Freudian techniques at the radio project, however, involved
		their application to principles of marketing and propaganda. Much of the Office of Radio Research’s
		contract work for companies was designed to give advice to advertising copywriters on their particular
		products: thus, for example, a study on the psychology of refrigerator purchasers framed its central
		question: “Do people have more subtle desires to which we could link the use of a refrigerator?”<a

	<h2 id="the-rockefeller-communications-seminar-nationalizing-research">
		The Rockefeller Communications Seminar: Nationalizing Research
	</h2>
	<p>
		Lazarsfeld’s project stood at the forefront of media research, due to its size, early founding
		date, and the number of its innovations. But even as his project was pushing the field in new
		directions, John Marshall at the Rockefeller foundation sought to bring scholars of other media
		into conversation with each other in a single field of “mass communications.” The single most
		important exercise in this attempt was a seminar held at the Rockefeller Foundation in 1939–40
		that tried to set a coherent set of goals for researchers in the field. The seminar’s members
		included researchers who were at the forefront of empirical studies of the media, such as
		Lazarsfeld and the political scientist Harold Lasswell, whose study of American propaganda after
		the first world war served as a paradigm for research into media effects in the early field; and
		comparative outsiders like Lynd and the British scholar I.A. Richards, one of the founders of
		the New Criticism in literary studies.<a
			href="#fn36"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref36"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		If the seminar was the moment of communications’ birth, the historical moment led the committee
		to midwife a creature considerably different than had been gestating at Lazarsfeld’s offices and
		elsewhere across the country. Marshall sent out invitations to the seminar in August 1939; by
		the first meeting in September, the German invasion of Poland made a university-based, social
		scientific approach to communications seem untenable. Lazarsfeld’s strategy of allying research
		to corporate interests paled, now, in comparison to the tremendous funding potential of the New
		Deal government gearing up to engage in a massive propaganda war. The suspicion of hysteria or
		manipulation promoted by the media was now dominated by the question of mobilization. “A purely
		theoretical and academic view of what mass communication is doing in society,” Marshall wrote,
		was no longer possible: instead, the seminar quickly turned its thoughts to changing and aiding
		government policy during the national emergency and after.<a
			href="#fn37"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref37"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		This did not prevent the seminar from trying to create a coherent framework for all
		communications research. Harold Lasswell quickly proposed that communications research should
		attempt to answer the interrelated questions of “who says what to whom with what effect,” a
		phrase that came to define a generation of communications research. In explicitly calling for
		attention to the production of information with the first two questions, they underlined an
		approach that had been applied only in rare cases in the first stages of Lazarsfeld’s
		audience-oriented studies. Content analysis, when attempted at all by the office of radio
		research, had largely been the province of humanistic critics like Adorno’s study of radio music
		or Leo Lowenthal’s article on the contents of popular biographies in magazines. But Lasswell was
		developing a new approach which promised to operationalize the question, at least with regards
		to written or spoken texts. It bore fruit in the fall of 1940 with Rockefeller funding for a
		project at the Library of Congress under Lasswell to count the appearance of key words, terms,
		or ideas in the foreign press (for example, changes in the mention of Russia in the German press
		preceding the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact).
	</p>
	<p>
		As notable as the additional questions is the question that is not asked: why the communication
		is happening at all. In a few of the committee’s minutes, the additional phrase actually is
		included in the formulation (Lasswell, in one draft of a joint memorandum, was to write about
		both “who communicates” and “for what purpose”).<a
			href="#fn38"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref38"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a
		>
		Its excision reveals an important change over the course of the seminar. As late as May, nine months
		into the project, the participants still did not agree on who the audience for communications research
		ought to be. Gorer harkened back to the original rationale for establishing the Princeton Radio Project
		by suggesting research should be targeted at educators; Lazarsfeld made the widest claims for their
		work with the suggestion that it be aimed at everyone who might use a medium. Lasswell, however,
		tried to situate the research more clearly in the context of the international situation by suggesting
		policy makers formed the primary audience for the medium.<a
			href="#fn39"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref39"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a
		> Within the black and white world of national policy during wartime, this necessarily meant that
		study of why the government chose to communicate would be pushed out of the mainstream.
	</p>
	<p>
		The government-oriented view of communications research won out in the committee’s ultimate
		self-presentation, a memorandum outlining their proposed direction for further research on mass
		communications. The essay is cast in terms of government necessity: since “events are obliging
		our central government to take on wider and wider responsibility for the welfare of the people,”
		the authors argue that improved communication will be essential in ensuring that “the exercise
		of that responsibility is to be democratic.”<a
			href="#fn40"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref40"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a
		>
		As a result, rather than holding the theoretical aim of understanding “the social significance of
		radio,” as did Lazarsfeld’s project, the seminar opted instead for the instrumental goal of “making
		communication more effective.” At the same time, the memo expands on Lazarsfeld and Stanton’s close
		alliance with pollsters by insistently linking communication research and opinion polling as two
		aspects of a single flow of communication, between the government and the people. (Other actors—such
		as the networks and advertisers—have dropped out of the picture). The government, they write, generates
		“a stream of proposal, explanation, and decision:” the people, in turn, produce “an answering stream
		of counter-proposal, explanation, and consent.” Communication research can aid the government by
		helping it to more clearly and effectively get its proposals and explanations heard; and it can help
		the people by making their responses accessible to government, through the use of opinion polling.
		Indeed, opinion polling, panel studies will be among the most important contributions communications
		research can make: research will primarily study how effectively the government has got its message
		across, not aid it in crafting the message. Despite the confident assertion that “the same research
		could, to be sure, be used to turn communication into powerful propaganda, if those responsible chose
		to do so,” the memo’s authors maintain a firm confidence that the research insights from their various
		disciplines and from marketing will bolster the war effort significantly.<a
			href="#fn41"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref41"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		The memo closes with a description of the institutional resources that will enable
		communications research on the government’s scale to proceed. Gallup and Roper’s polling
		agencies are mentioned by name, as are Princeton’s Public Opinion Research Project, Columbia’s
		Office of Radio Research, and the Graduate Library School at Chicago. The members of the seminar
		offer to immediately begin deploying the existing research in service of government–popular
		communications, “if they are able to secure the help they need – cooperation from those
		concerned, and funds to meet the costs.” They end by calling for “an institute of research in
		communication… similar to the national institutes for research in economics, which would, in
		assigning responsibility, ensure the comparability of findings, and their pooling in some
		central formulation and reporting.”<a
			href="#fn42"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref42"

		The Harvard Radiobroadcasting Research Project: Research stops at Politics
	</h2>
	<p>
		In tying the future of communications research to the government even more fundamentally than
		Lazarsfeld had tied it to corporate interests, the changes described by the Communications
		Seminar continued a process of exclusion that would ultimately supplant the methodological
		diversity that hallmarked earlier communications research. A good example of how the new focus
		on government strangled ongoing research can be seen in the history of one of the first
		organizations to receive the communications seminar’s memorandum: the Harvard Radiobroadcasting
		Research project, which began in 1940. The Harvard project was directed by Carl Joachim
		Friedrich, like Lazarsfeld an émigré who had arrived from the German speaking world before
		political events made it entirely necessary. Friedrich’s office was much smaller than
		Lazarsfeld’s, did not mount any large-scale statistical studies, and only published six
		article-length reports. In this, more limited scope, it was typical of the sort of university
		research in mass communications that was taking place not only at Harvard and Columbia, but
		around the country—in early 1939, Lazarsfeld identified radio research programs underway at Ohio
		State, Kansas State College, and the University of Wisconsin, among others. A substantial
		proportion of this research was done to improve the educational effectiveness of radio, or to
		use it for community outreach; but other studies at Wayne University and the University of
		Mississippi were engaged directly in the sort of attitude studies of listeners that Lazarsfeld
		and the networks were interested in.<a
			href="#fn43"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref43"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a
		> Friedrich’s study, like most of these others, has slipped below the notice of historians of communications,
		although its reports are still occasionally cited by scholars of early radio.
	</p>
	<p>
		Friedrich’s study is important not only because it was one instance in a proliferation of
		research, however: it also represents an attempt to expand communications research by advancing
		producer-side studies in general, and particularly the relationship between the government and
		the networks. Friedrich was a political scientist (his best known work was a collaborative study
		of totalitarianism with his student Zbigniew Brzezinski<a
			href="#fn44"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref44"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a
		>), and the project’s studies chiefly looked at various aspects of the interaction among the
		courts, Congress, the Federal Commmunications Commission, and radio broadcasters. But while, it
		represented a new path in research, Friedrich maintained strong ties to the burgeoning
		communications infrastructure. Like Cantril and Stanton’s initial proposal, the Harvard project
		was initially funded by John Marshall at the Rockefeller Foundation; and its only full-time
		employee was Jeanette Sayre, whose chief qualification for the job was a year of work with
		Lazarsfeld’s Office of Radio Research. Friedrich himself continued to teach in the government
		department at Harvard, including leading a seminar in communications whose visiting guests
		included David Riesman and Frank Stanton.
	</p>
	<p>
		The industry was happy to see political studies of radio being done, only provided they
		supported the broadcasters interests: one NBC executive wrote to ask Friedrich’s support against
		some of the wartime controls since “if the Fly orders stand unmodified, network broadcasting, as
		we have known it, is at an end.”<a
			href="#fn45"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref45"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a
		>
		The researchers could not help being taken for political actors themselves—although the final publication
		maintains a studious neutrality, Sayre reported to Friedrich that one highly partisan new-dealer
		she met greeted her by asking if she was from “that lousy Republican outfit in Harvard that had sent
		out the questionnaire on Federal Agencies.”<a
			href="#fn46"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref46"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a
		>
		But ultimately, their investment in political issues scared off other communications researchers.
		Lazarsfeld declined to publish the project’s study of radiobroadcasting control, claiming at the
		time that it was too “anecdotal” within the context of the ORR’s work. The line between anecdote
		and a level of political independence that could damage the fledgling field, however, was so close
		that excluding one might mean excluding the other. Lazarsfeld himself later admitted that he had
		“a more complex motivation characteristic of someone responsible for a new and struggling institution,”
		stemming from his desire to put the ORR in a mediating function rather than take positions that might
		be unpleasant to either the FCC or the networks.<a
			href="#fn47"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref47"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is not to say that communications research at in the Harvard school of government failed
		solely because of insidious political pressures. Lazarsfeld did, later, colloborate with
		Friedrich and Sayre to publish a study on the less volatile topic of foreign language
		broadcasting. But ultimately, Friedrich’s project did fall by the wayside, and largely because
		the field was not interested in accepting political research into the fold. The Rockefeller
		Foundation declined to continue funding the project after the first grant expired in late 1941.
		Nor did Harvard, observing how radio research at Columbia and Princeton had proceeded largely
		without university funding, see any benefits of paying for its own interdisciplinary program in
		radio research. A university committee convened on the topic concluded that although “study of
		radio is part of the business of a great education institution,” “there seems to be no reason
		why they should not proceed within the existing organizations and facilities for research
		purposes.”<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>
		Thus at once, the Harvard project captures two important trends within the field: the failure of
		the large private universities to engage systematically in radio or mass communications research,
		and the disinterest of the field as a whole in studies of control. As the war came more and more
		to the fore in new work in mass communications, both trends would come to dominate the field.

		The war, the industry, and the sequestration of a field
	</h1>
	<p>
		Carl Friedrich’s departure withdrawal from academic communications research was early, but not
		was only part of broad shift that saw the new field, in its consolidation, begin to shed much of
		the ideological and methodological pluralism of its early years. Beginning with the war and
		culminating in the new research institutes of the 1950s, the field began to orient around a new
		research model, while the personnel and techniques that characterized it in its formative years
		brought their insights either back to the disciplines from which they came, or sought to apply
		them working for the government or private sector.
	</p>
	<h2 id="nationalizing-the-war-effort">Nationalizing the war effort</h2>
	<p>
		The immediate result of the war, and the conscious response to it by the leaders of the field in
		the Communications Seminar, was an immediate focus on research that would be of immediate use in
		the war effort. As a result propaganda research, monitoring of radio broadcasts, and domestic
		opinion research were given the most prominence. Producer-oriented studies of the American
		broadcasting system fell by the wayside. Methodological innovations became conceived in terms of
		their utility to the federal government, which by its nature ruled out research which, like
		Friedrich’s Radio Control study, was neither directly scalable and, moreover, presumed to
		mediate between government and business rather than serve the former.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the more quantitative research techniques, this represented an enormous boom, so much so
		that Harold Lasswell could describe private research in entirely utilitarian terms as an
		incubator for government work. “The special contribution of private agencies is in the sphere of
		tool-sharpening, rather than tool-using. Tool-using is a mass duplication job, best done by
		central direction and firmly knit bureaucracies. Tool-sharpening, on the contrary, calls for new
		ideas, new devices, new kinds of personnel. Here is where the alert private agency whose
		resources are mobile can deliver its most telling aid to the national effort.”<a
			href="#fn49"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref49"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a
		> The Rockefeller-funded communications projects recast themselves as just this sort of tool-sharpeners
		in the service of the war effort. Marshall encouraged Lasswell’s Library of Congress study and Lazarsfeld’s
		ORR to quickly assemble lists of the staff that they had lost to wartime mobilization, as proof of
		the benefits to be gained from their research. The numbers were impressive: Lasswell was able to
		name 39 people trained at his program to the Department of Justice’s special defense unit alone,
		and when the Office of War Information was established in 1942, it drew many of its staff out of
		the many Rockefeller projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		The major new projects in the field also tended to be the same type of tool-sharpening
		endeavors, even when their founders came out of similar backgrounds to the earlier studies. The
		Rockefeller foundation authorized a substantial grant for a study of Totalitarian Communications
		at the New School for Social Research in 1940, shows much of the shift in the field. The new
		project was led by not one but two German émigrés, Ernst Kris and Hans Speier. They, like
		Lazarsfeld or Friedrich, brought diverse theoretical backgrounds to the study of communications;
		Speier as an economist and sociologist who could work with large social issues, and Kris as a
		psychologist (trained by Freud in psychoanalysis). But, constrained by its political program,
		the study hardly reflected on the domestic system. Indeed, trust in indigenous American
		broadcasters came to form a bedrock faith for their work. They once wrote “the foremost result
		achieved by enemy propagandists in their own countries and elsewhere is the strengthening of
		distrust of mass communication.” Their job was not to cause suspicion of communications in
		democratic society; it was to unveil one of the sources of such suspicions. Even in its semantic
		construction, Speier and Kris argued, totalitarian communication differed fundamentally from
		democratic communication. Through studies like this, the horizons of mass communication studies
		shrank even as their size and number proliferated.<a

	<p>
		The mobilization of the existing research institutes towards war research, and the loss of much
		of their staff to the OWI and other wartime offices, marked a major turning point in the
		relation of academic communications research to the corporate sphere as well. The result was the
		quick collapse of the uneasy alliance between networks and academics that had characterized the
		Princeton Radio Project and the earlier interplay between research like Stanton’s doctoral
		thesis and the research department of the networks. Therefore, even as the wartime propaganda
		agencies built on the work of the early communications researchers and drew away much of their
		staff, significant numbers of researchers also departed into the private sector to continue
		lines of thought with few government applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		But while commercial communications research was sidelined in the Rockefeller-funded projects
		and in the universities in general, it had made significant enough strides that it was able to
		easily ensconce itself back in the networks. Stanton, when hired at the NBC research office in
		1936, had been one of two staff members there; by the early forties, the research office was
		rapidly adding new staff members and Stanton himself had moved from being a peripheral hire in a
		small department to, at the request of the CEO, the president of the company. Corporate
		executives like H.M. Beville at NBC no longer needed academics to tell them what their data was
		good for: the rush of social-scientific interest made them realize its value and shed their
		earlier complacency about their business model. Academic training would remain a valuable asset
		in the networks for decades—in 1983 the directors of social research at NBC, CBS, and ABC had
		all been trained by Lazarsfeld<a
			href="#fn51"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref51"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a
		>—but universities had shifted to being a locus of training from a source of actual research
		findings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Others followed even farther than had Lazarsfeld in seeing the expansive records of the network
		as inviting important new research in social science. Matthew Chappell, an academic psychologist
		who collaborated on a study of the radio audience with a leading pollster, breathlessly
		concluded in 1943 that “all advertising and media research is psychological
		research—psychological research of such scope and magnitude that no university could dream of
		conducting it.” That Chappell identified one of the revolutions in progress in 1943 as “the
		migration of research from the seclusion of the academy to the field of competitive enterprise”<a
			href="#fn52"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref52"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a
		> might seem to fly in the face of the conclusion that the government gradually took over the functions
		that foundations had nurtured in university incubators. In fact, though, it simply represents another
		side in the fruition of the applied techniques developed by the researchers. Just as, by 1943, the
		techniques of Lasswell’s office were largely well enough developed to allow government agencies to
		apply them without further exploratory research of their own, so too could Lazarsfeld’s research
		be applied by radio networks and advertising agencies, who were eager to know about the effects of
		communication on the individual in large part so they better refine their tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		Three defections from Lazarsfeld’s team during the war show how succesful the applied techniques
		of the Office of Radio Research could be in the business world. Two have been mentioned above in
		passing: the twin hiring, by the leading advertising firm McCann-Erickson, of Herta Herzog and
		Hans Zeisel in 1943. Herzog was initially hired by Marion Harper to do qualitative research—the
		kind of follow-up, in depth interviews like those that formed the basis of the <em
			>Invasion from Mars</em
		> study (of which Herzog was the co-author) or that explored the choices made on the program analyzer.
		While Zeisel, another old Austrian associate of Lazarsfeld’s, gravitated back to academia (he took
		a position as an instructor of statistics at Rutgers at the same time he moved to McCann-Erickson,
		and in 1953 became a law professor at the University of Chicago), Herzog remained a prominent force
		in advertising—after rising to vice-president at McCann-Erickson, she became a founding member of
		the renowned firm Jack Tinker &amp; Partners. Another immigrant hired by the Radio Project, Ernest
		Dichter, brought Freudian methods even farther into mainstream corporate culture. After moving from
		the ORR to work as a staff research psychologist at CBS, he became famous in marketing as the founder
		of “motivation research,” which sought to use Freudian psychological categories to influence consumer
		behavior.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, it was not only the sophisticated statistical techniques of the early corporate studies
		that came to dominate (like the program analyzer) from the behaviorist tradition. The core
		elements of Herzog’s and Dichter’s work lay in Freudian antecedents; they privileged the
		analyst’s creative powers against amalgamative statistical techniques. But they continued to
		share with the early psychological studies an individualistic outlook about communications
		effects that looked at the individual as the subject of a procedure, rather than the participant
		in a process. In Dichter’s case, it was clear from near the beginning that his research was so
		instrumentally oriented that it would only fit in as corporate work. But even within the
		academic discipline, interest was shifting to this sort of instrumental research, and away from
		the larger aspirations of some of its founders.
	</p>
	<h2 id="epilogue-professionalization-and-diaspora">Epilogue: Professionalization and Diaspora</h2>
	<p>
		In 1959, Bernard Berelson declared in the <em>Public Opinion Quarterly</em> that communication
		research was “withering away.” The former student of Douglas Waples and collaborator of Paul
		Lazarsfeld, who had been called the “Great White Hope” of communications research, pronounced,
		“the innovators have left or are leaving the field, and no ideas of comparable scope and
		generating power are emerging.”<a
			href="#fn53"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref53"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a
		>
		He acknowledged the emergence of several new approaches, including a “broad historical approach”
		led by David Riesman and a “journalistic approach” represented by the new communications schools,
		but argued that these approaches had either been largely ignored, or were not backed by the same
		field-shaping intellectual force of the previous generation of communications theorists. Those involved
		in the expansion of the field into journalism and in the formation of new Ph.D. programs scoffed
		at Berelson’s claims. Wilbur Schramm wryly suggested death “is a somewhat livelier condition than
		I had anticipated.” New doctoral students, a continuing synergy across professional and scientific
		disciplines, and the emergence of a dedicated class of researchers without other disciplinary formations
		made communications in the late 1950s, he thought, “an extraordinarily vital field.”<a
			href="#fn54"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref54"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		But though Berelson’s claims were incomprehensible for those who saw greater focus in the field,
		his argument nonetheless points toward a significant shift in the discipline during and
		following the war. Beginning with Cantril’s defection to public opinion research in 1938–39,
		almost all of the major figures in early communications research slipped away into other fields.
		Berelson identified four chief figures in early communications research, and noted that of the
		three survivors (Kurt Lewin had died in 1947), all had retreated into other disciplines:
		Lazarsfeld into mathematical applications of social research, Lasswell into political science,
		and Hovland into increasingly detailed studies of cognitive processes. Indeed, if one looks at
		the primary contributors to communications publications in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the
		attrition from the early generation is far greater than can be attributed to death alone. In
		addition to the five mentioned above, Berelson himself had abandoned most systematic
		communications research, Friedrich had switched to more conventional political science work even
		before the war ended, and most of Lazarsfeld’s collaborators at Columbia had moved either into
		sociology or into the private sector.
	</p>
	<p>
		What remained was certainly an active field, and one not necessarily hostile to new intellectual
		influences. Indeed, as researchers of the later history of communications have shown, this was
		the period when other methodological innovations, such as the information theory of Claude
		Shannon, began to play an important role in the evolution of the field. But at the same time, it
		was one that maintained a considerably smaller purview of research. The atomization of society
		in the television generation was a major concern in works like David Riesman’s <em
			>The Lonely Crowd.</em
		>
		Such concerns, however, lay outside the restricted range of problems in the new field; Riesman himself
		had been involved in the field in its early days, coming to speak to Friedrich’s communications seminars
		at Harvard and working on the committee on communications that Berelson led at Chicago. But although
		he came more slowly than Berelson to the conclusion that communications research was atrophying,
		he wrote a sort of concurrence to Berelson’s article lamenting lamenting the lack of “small-scale
		empirical sorties” to answer “large-scale questions” as many of the Columbia and Princeton studies
		had done.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, the study of short-term, measurable effects came to lie at the heart of training in
		communications. Producer-side studies, like Friedrich’s analysis of political control or
		Adorno’s studies of the music industry, waned. As the field began to train students, it prepared
		them more and more for the sort of jobs that the earlier mass communications studies had already
		populated: in broadcasting, in advertising, and in government. The newly ascendant cold war
		bureaucracy, in particular, encouraged the growth of studies of international communications,
		which became, even by Paul Lazarsfeld’s estimation, the most dynamic site in an intellectually
		atrophying field.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"
			><sup>56</sup></a
		>
		Perhaps the major figure in this new institutional consolidation was Wilbur Schramm, whose 1954 reader
		<em>The Process and Effects of Mass Communications</em>
		became one of the definitive texts of this newly restricted field.<a
			href="#fn57"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref57"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a
		>
		Reviewers hailed it for bringing the unity of a scientific endeavor to a fractured field: one praised
		it for overcoming the field’s “many false starts, a good deal of esoteric material and an apparent
		inordinate emphasis on methodology.”<a
			href="#fn58"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref58"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a
		>
		But the unity it brought had its price. The book began as a reader for the United States Information
		Agency (the independent federal agency that oversaw many aspects of public diplomacy, including the
		Voice of America broadcasts), and its main groupings reflect the interests of a broadcaster: it moves
		through getting the attention of an audience, “getting the meaning understood,” “modifying attitudes
		and opinions,” and culminates in a discussion of “special problems of achieving an effect with international
		communications. By comparison, an earlier reader edited by Berelson had included several essays on
		media control, popular culture, and their standing in a democratic society.<a
			href="#fn59"
			class="footnote-ref"
			id="fnref59"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a
		> Such topics did not necessarily become taboo; but rapidly, it became clear to those who were interested
		in them that communications would not be the arena in which to pursue them.
	</p>
	<p>
		This change reflected a new ossification that marked the waning of the methodological pluralism
		of the late 1930s. Communications was a discipline, now, and now longer just a field. And it was
		a discipline with considerably different structures. The war had been a brush fire that cleared
		out the old dominant institutions and prepared the ground for a new monoculture. The agencies
		that formerly lay at the heart of communications research fed the flames of federal research;
		but interest in communications research in Washington was bound to temporary offices and
		temporary projects, and when the offices at the OWI and Library of Congress closed down, the
		ecology of the field was radically different. The leading experts in research had moved on,
		severing communications’ infant ties sociology and political science: now it operated as a
		series of research projects in large part funded by outside forces. In some ways, this weaning
		was necessary for the research to continue; once it was clear that Lazarsfeld, Lasswell, and the
		rest were not going to devote their careers to the furthering of communications research, their
		absence helped clear the ground for a new generation of researchers who would. But it was not
		only individuals who were lost to the field—it was the rich variety of backgrounds that made the
		early days of research so innovative. Outsiders like Robert Lynd and Theodor Adorno, who were
		acknowledged to have important contributions they could make (even if they did not always
		actually contribute), had little role to play in the congealed discipline. As a result of this
		transformation, it no longer held its earlier promise of offering a theory of society as a
		whole. Part of the cause was undoubtedly a naturalization of the media—the American social
		scientists of the 1950s were further removed from the creation of the electronic media in the
		United States, and many of them could come to seem them as almost natural features of the
		cultural landscape. It only reinforced their complacency more that they in fact were, much more
		than their predecessors, <em>American</em> social scientists; with peace in Europe, the influx of
		Europeans with diverse research interest would not be able to play a formative role in the field.
	</p>
	<p>
		What was still as known as communications research began to be removed, even spatially, from the
		foremost writers in its predecessor fields. When Lazarsfeld moved away from research, the new
		centers of communications arose mostly in the large public universities of the Midwest,
		particularly at the centers founded by Wilbur Schramm at Iowa and Illinois. To be sure, Stanford
		did gain a Schramm-founded center of its own: but other private research universities like
		Harvard, Chicago, and Columbia would not again consider placing radio or communications research
		at the front of their institutional missions. But while they did not always retain the
		institutional ties to communications research, the universities, like the broadcasting and
		advertising corporations, continued to benefit from the significant thinkers who had been drawn
		to it in its early years. Just as communications itself had taken in the exiles and the marginal
		researchers from other countries and disciplines, its own diaspora would reverberate far afield.

					The term “received history” is from Gertrude J. Robinson and Willard D. Rowland, Jr.,
					"Preface," <em>Communicatio</em>n 10 (1988): 93. The canonical example of this account,
					due to the preeminence of its primary author, is Wilbur Lang Schramm, Steven H. Chaffee,
					and Everett M. Rogers,
					<em>The Beginnings of Communication Study in America : A Personal Memoi</em>r (Thousand
					Oaks: Sage Publications, 1997). By Schramm’s account the “four fathers” are Paul
					Lazarsfeld, Harold D. Lasswell, Kurt Lewin, and Carl I. Hovland. (This list of founders
					was first established by Bernard Berelson, "The State of Communication Research,"
					<em>The Public Opinion Quarterl</em>y 23, no. 1 (1959).) Younger writers in a similar
					tradition (most notably, Everett M. Rogers,
					<em>A History of Communication Study : A Biographical Approac</em>h (New York: The Free
					Press, 1994).) sometimes demote these four to simple forefathers, and consider Schramm
					himself (who founded three communications research institutes, including the first major
					program to offer the communications Ph.D., at the University of Illinois in 1947) the true
					founder of the discipline. Another traditional account is Shearon Lowery and Melvin L.
					DeFleur, <em>Milestones in Mass Communication Research : Media Effect</em>s, 2nd ed. (New
					York: Longman, 1988).

					The equivalently canonical text for the revisionists is Todd Gitlin, "Media Sociology: The

					Robinson in Everette E. Dennis and Ellen Wartella,
					<em>American Communication Research : The Remembered Histor</em>y,
					<em>Lea's Communication Serie</em>s (Mahwah, N.J.: Erlbaum, 1996). have suggested that the
					traditional emphasis on Schramm and the four fathers ignores other important critical
					antecedents of modern communications research. She and others propose that the history of
					the field should concentrate on gathering the roles of the various scholars who have

					The Rockefeller funding, and Lazarsfeld’s directorship, would last through a period of
					name changes in administration that are testament to the sometimes precarious
					institutional situations in which Lazarsfeld operated. The Princeton Radio Research
					Project (which, despite its name, was actually located at the University of Newark)
					became, in 1940, the Office of Radio Research at Columbia University; the Office of Radio
					Research eventually became Columbia’s Bureau of Applied Social Research. With some notable
					exceptions, the staff and researchers were retained at each of these junctures. Since the
					ostensible university affiliation was often not particularly important to the auspices
