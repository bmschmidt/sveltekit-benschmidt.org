I am director of digital humanities and
clinical associate professor of history at New York
University.

I use humanistic data analysis and data visualization to help people
think about the American past in new ways. My primary current research project
is [*Creating Data*](http://creatingdata.us), a digital monograph
about the organization of information in the American state in the
late 19th century. I also write occasionally about higher education
([teaching evaluations](http://benschmidt.org/profGender) and
[humanities policy](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/)),
[narrative anachronism](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/01/nobody-said-racial-equality-in-1865-the-anachronistic-english-of-lincoln/266990/)
and [plot structure], and
[political history.](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/01/the-language-of-the-state-of-the-union/384575/)

At NYU, I teach courses in digital humanities and history of the United States
and technology in the history department and through the program in Digital Humanities,
of which I am the director.

I live in Manhattan.
