I've been meaning to write called "Why I hate Python" for years, but I've
always held off because it's such a self-evidently absurd statement.
Who hates Python? In the humanities, only the
dwindling ranks of Ruby holdouts seem to have anything but respect
for the lingua franca of computer science. I Google around periodically
waiting to see when the reign of terror will end, but all I see are people
cheerily acceding to its ongoing dominance and viewing it as inevitable
that everything will switch to Python eventually.

Why do I hate Python, then?

To alienate yet a few more people:
I feel the same way about Python that I feel about Massimo's Vignelli's 1972
New York subway map; perfectly content with the way that it makes it possible
to get from point A to point B, but irritated by its verbosity and
utterly flabbergasted by the love that it seems to inspire.

It boils down to this. Just about every programming system I've put any time into
has done more than let me write programs that work; it's also changed the way I think
about what coding is and how computers work. The only two that have never
given that Eureka moment are bash and Python. They're fine. They're vanilla. But
while everyone knows that bash is lousy but irreplacable, somehow Python
has acquired cachet.

But I can't wait for it to end. Fortunately, I think it will; I can see a
future coming in which most data analysis is done in Javascript with the beating
core carried on in Rust or Go or something compiled straight to Web Assembly.
It will be great.

Python is boring, proscriptive, and frustratingly designed.

What do I like about Python?

1. The tuples are first class objects; that they can be dictionary keys.
