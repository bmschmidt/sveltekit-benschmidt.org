I've been doing a lot of my data exploration lately on Observable Notebooks,
which is--sort of--a Javascript version of Jupyter notebooks that automatically
runs all the code inline. Married with Vega-Lite or D3, it provides a way
to make data exploration editable and shareable in a way that R and python
data code simply can't be; and since it's all HTML, you can do more interesting
things.

Of course, that leaves all that writing on their site, where it will likely
eventually vanish. I'm generally willing to live with that. But it's also nice
to be embed the charts over here, even if they'll die when Observable does.

The [observable version](https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/transitioning-between-circle-packs-historical-us-electio) of this page will almost certainly look better, but you can get a quick
idea of the contents below.
