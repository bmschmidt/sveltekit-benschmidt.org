As part of the *Creating Data* project, I've been doing a lot of work lately with interactive scatterplots. The most interesting of them is [this one about the full Hathi collection](https://t.co/erWeUkR9Fk).
But I've posted a few more I want to link to from here:

* [An exploration of co-occurring street names in the United States](http://creatingdata.us/etc/streets/)
* A [description of the process of making them and tiling data hierarchically](http://creatingdata.us/techne/deep_scatterplots/)
* [A general description of visual bibliographies with an analysis of fiction datasets.](http://creatingdata.us/techne/bibliographies/)
