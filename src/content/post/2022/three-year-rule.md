The American Historical Association meeting has once again produced some acrimony about about the state of the historical job market, with dispirited grad students and dispirited recent graduates wondering when is the right time to quit.

One thing that has re-emerged is discussion of a so-called "three year rule," in which hiring departments supposedly only 
hire "fresh" PhDs, ignoring qualified people who have been on the market for years in search of the shiny new thing.

I do not think that this rule actually exists. Yes, it is the case
