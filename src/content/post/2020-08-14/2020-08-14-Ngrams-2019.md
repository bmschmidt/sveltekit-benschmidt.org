I learned from Scott Weingart on Twitter that the Google Ngrams
website was updated in February. Let's take a look and see what
differences these changes make.

I'm going to simply use individual ngrams as proxies for phenomena,
and I may be a little oblique in explaining why I think they work. If
you have any questions why I use some phrase as an indicator, ask on Twitter.

# OCR quality.

# Corpus weirdness

One simple question worth asking is what new words appear in the 2010s
that didn't before.

Two of the largest are 'bbe' and 'kjv', which each appear half a
million times in 2018. I suspect that 'bbe' means "bible in
basic english," and "KJV" means "King James Bible." There are 1000
books containing 'bbe', which seems to indicate that maybe 1000 copies
of this somehow migrated into Google Books for a single year.
