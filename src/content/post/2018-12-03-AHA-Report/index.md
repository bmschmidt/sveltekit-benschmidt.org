I wrote this year's report on history majors for the American Historical Association's
magazine, *Perspectives on History*; it takes a medium term view of at
the significant hit the history major has taken since the 2008

[here](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report).



There's also an
[interview with me about the topic](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report)
in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
