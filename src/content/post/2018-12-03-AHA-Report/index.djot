I wrote this year's report on history majors for the American Historical
Association's magazine, _Perspectives on History_; it takes a medium
term view of at the significant hit the history major has taken since
the 2008 financial crisis. You can read it
[here](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report).

There's also an [interview with me about the
topic](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report)
in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
