Days from when I [said](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2010/12/todays-times-article.html) "[Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=adrian+gonzalez&date=2010-12-4&sa=X) for historical terms might be worse than nothing" to the release of "[Google ngrams](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/):" 12. So: we'll get to see!  
  
  
Also, I take back everything I said about 'digital humanities' having unfortunate implications. "[Culturomics](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/12/15/science.1199644)"—like 'culturenomics', but fluffier?—takes the cake.  
  
  
Anyway, I should have some more thoughts on this later. I have them now, I suppose, but let me digest. For now, just dwell on the total lack of any humanists in that article promising to revolutionize the humanities.
