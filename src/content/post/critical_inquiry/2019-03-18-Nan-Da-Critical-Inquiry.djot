title: A computational critique of a computational critique of
  computational critique.
---

Critical Inquiry has posted an article by Nan Da offering [a critique of
some subset of digital
humanities](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/702594)
that she calls "Computational Literary Studies," or CLS. The premise of
the article is to demonstrate the poverty of the field by showing that
the new structure of CLS is easily dismantled by the master's own tools.
It appears to have succeeded enough at gaining attention that it clearly
does some kind of work far outsize to the merits of the article itself.

The piece is not a useful contribution; it's a magic trick that relies
on the inattention or ignorance of its readers. While it pretends to
demystify computation for literary among literary critics, it in fact
does exactly the opposite; it operates through a series of feints and
misdirections that repeatedly misstates the plain text of other
scholars--in both literature and statistics--says, and what the
statistical work she herself has done is. The article is predicated on
an lack of statistical sophistication by the readers of _Critical
Inquiry._

The "computational" aspect of Da's case is twofold:

1. It asserts that actually existing CLS is ridden with statistical
   errors that could be easily corrected, and claims to have performed
   replications.

2. It offers that in _other_ areas--science and industry--computational
   methods are being deployed perfectly and appropriately; but that
   sadly, such methods *can not* be applied in literary studies because
   they have demonstrably demonstrated only absurditites and
   tautologies.

I do not believe it would be possible to write an article that defends
both of these points. If existing pieces are so heavily flawed, then we
probably don't know the limits of the knowable. If, on the other handÂ¸
we're able to tell that CLS will never produce useful results for
literature, it would probably only be because the existing literature
give us some sense of what's possible.

But together--and this is where the appeal comes from--they break some
fresh ground in the genre of anti-digital-humanities polemic. To
straightforwardly attack the cultural authority of numbers has become
increasingly problematic in the past few years. The hegemony of STEM has
increased inside the university, making the gambit more instutionally
dangerous; and at the same time, humanists have come to realize there
may be forces in the world yet more sinister than scientists. The
rhetorical tools you can deploy against positivism are strong, but they
risk appearing to make it seem--say--that maybe we shouldn't listen to
climate scientists. So Da's piece posits that everyone else is using
numbers right--but also holds out that the exercise in replication and
methodological analysis (a good thing) proffered here _don't_ actually
hold the way out for better resource.

Da moves past anti-positivism into something fresh-- call it
computational NIMBYism. Rather than pooh-pooh statistical reasoning, she
elevates it by incanting the language of quantification against itself.
Far _more_ than anyone I've seen in any humanities article, she asserts
that scientists do something arcane, powerful, and true. But she returns
from this promised land with hard-won truths for literary critics; its
computationalists are false prophets engaged in a cargo-cult version of
data science, and the true religion has nothing to say for literary
scholars.

{#the-response-the-article-engenders}
## The response the article engenders.

A careful effort to replicate published articles is necessary.
Fortunately, it is also something that happens, albeit not as much as
might be useful. I expansively discussed the concerns Da raises about
topic modeling across time in Underwood and Goldstone's work in
2013.\[@schmidt\_words\_2013\] Their response is explicitly contained
within the paper Da read. The final footnote in Ted Underwood's new book
raises precisely the same questions about the way that a Stanford
Literary Lab pamphlets use of bigram entropy as a distinguishing
measure. [^1]

But this isn't that article. The computational evidence deployed
here--the thing that tries to make this piece stand out--is striking in
its sloppiness even compared to the works it pretends to debunk. Perhaps
the whole piece is intended as a parody of what can slide into top
literary journals nowadays. (It is indeed the case that Critical Inquiry
will allow you to publish with terribly inadequate code appendices and
reviewers incompetent to assess the validity of your work.) But it
certainly does not show that _good_ statistics can obliterate the _bad_
statistics that are widespread. Instead, the most it could do is
demonstrate that the literary profession is as easily bamboozled by
numbers as Da says.

This tension of the two goals evident in the first piece of the set, on
a Ted Underwood piece on genre classification. She at once claims a
simple correction--

> Underwood should train his model on pre-1941 detective fiction (A) as
> compared to pre-1941 random stew and post-1941 detective fiction (B)
> as compared to post-1941 random stew, instead of one random stew for
> both, to rule out the possibility that the difference between A and B
> is not broadly descriptive of a larger trend (since all literature
> might be changed after 1941).

_and_ that Underwood uses methods that could never find differences
between genres.

It is true that Underwood does use methods inadequate to prove there is
no difference in detective fiction pre and post-1930. (Her use of the
year "1941" is a mistake--it seems to stem from confusing the date of
one of Underwood's sources with the year he chose for a testing cutoff).
This is an absurdly high bar--of course _something_ changed, if only the
existence of words like 'television' and 'databases.' Underwood says as
much. The actual article is caught up in a more interesting discussion
of the _comparative_ stability of genres. The core argument is not, as
Da says, that genres have been "more or less consistent from the 1820s
to the present," but that detective fiction, the gothic, and science
fiction--*specifically*-- show different patterns, with detective
fiction being a far more coherent pattern than the gothic novel. By
focusing only detective work, she's missing the entire argument of the
article.

That this doesn't merit correction or retraction is depressing.

I don't know what Underwood used to train. But if he did allow the
'random stew' to contain both pre- and post-1930 work that would make
the performance of his model _more_ remarkable, not less--it would
indicate that it was correctly tagging Elmore Leonard (say) novels as
detectives even though they use words like "fax" or "polaroid" it had
previously seen in the post-1930 set.

Where Da's method really shines, though, is in the random statistical
vocabulary she brings to bear.

All that Underwood has shown in using word frequency homogeneity to
differentiate detective fiction from random fiction is that the
difference between pre- and post-1941 detective fiction is not as
significant as its difference from random fiction. This does not mean
that the same method can capture the difference between different types
of detective fiction. After all, statistics automatically assumes that
95 percent of the time there is no difference and that only 5 percent of
the time there is a difference. That is what it means to look for
p-value less than 0.05. Think of it this way: if everyone can agree that
something is changing---even Underwood concedes that genres evolve---but
you have devised one way that concludes that it does not, it does not
necessarily mean that you have found something.

In the first specific critique, the article talks about 95% p-values in
the following way: "statistics automatically assumes that 95 percent of
the time there is no difference and that only 5 percent of the time
there is a difference. That is what it means to look for p-value less
than 0.05."

To look for a p-value under 0.05 is to look for a pattern that would
only occur 5% of the time as a result of random variation. It's not a
great threshold. But Underwood's paper does not rely on them.

So let's take a look at how well the statistical claims here hold up: is
the debunking useful?

{#jockers-and-kiriloff-on-gender}
## Jockers and Kiriloff on Gender

Da's critique of Underwood relies mostly on failures of reading. The
next section, on work by Matthew Jockers and Gabi Kirilloff, showcases
the way her piece rests rhetorically on the innumeracy of her
readership. Her critique of Jockers and Kiriloff is, as she says, that
they "present a statistical no-result finding as a finding."

In order to do so, she swamps her readers with a blizzard of statistical
language that she can justifiably assume will sound plausible to the
readers of _Critical Inquiry_. Her promise is that she will offer "a
clear explanation of the computational work that CLS actually does"
(605). In her two paragraphs on Jockers and Kiriloff, she tosses out the
following observations:

- "Let us say that you are measuring the overlap of features between two
  sets of data using a standard 5 percent confidence level; out of n
  possible shared features, 0.05n will automatically be significant."
- "In good statistical work, the burden to show difference within
  naturally occurring differences ('diff in diff') is extremely high."
- "This paper does not perform a bootstrap, which means the
  literary-historical suggestions that follow this genre classification
  do not stand."
- "Practitioners have to apply the Bonferroni Correction to conventional
  statistical thresholds of significance used for data mining."

And so on. This blizzard of terminology establishes for the innumerate
reader that they finally have an expert who will debunk statistics for
them, while freeing them of the burdensome requirement to think for
themselves.

But much of this is word salad; what stands is unimportant. The claim
that 5% of features "will automatically be significant" seems to
approach the claim that she has already had to retract: that "statistics
automatically assumes that 95 percent of the time there is no difference
and that only 5 percent of the time there is a difference. That is what
it means to look for p-value less than 0.05." 'Diff in diff' is indeed
an important tool, but it's not about whether testing whether two
distributions are different from each other; it's about testing whether
a post-treatment experimental group (like recipients of experimental
chemotherapy, or counties that received Gates foundation grants) saw a
significant [time series
change.](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/difference-difference-estimation)
Bootstrap resampling to generate confidence intervals can be useful, but
to randomly invoke it, as here, is about as sophisticated as demanding
that every article, regardless of content, take a transnational
approach.

To say that significance testing should apply the Bonferroni correction
is _not_ nonsense. But neither is it something that Da does. As with her
discussion of Underwood, the exercise relies on coming up with a straw
man description of the claim of the article, and then rejecting that. Da
focuses mostly on the question of whether there are statistically
significant differences in gendered use of verbs. Jockers and Kiriloff
use the method of nearest shrunken centroids as input into their model
for a variety of reasons having to do with model interpretability. [^2]

But Jockers and Kiriloff's findings _are_ significant at the level that
Da suggests, and it is Da's work that is truly sloppy. In the appendix,
she publishes a comparison that obviously mislabels its bins (it claims
that her replication found the "she killed" and "he wept" are gender
stereotypes, rather than the opposite). If the goal is simply to find
which words show strong gendered patterns of usage, it's unclear why she
would choose a different statistical method. In the appendix, claims to
have performed a replication and found that "Overall, the percentage
differences between these top most correlated verbs for each gender was
very low (0.031% to 0.307%) meaning that while a difference can be
found, male/female is not very differentiated from one another if we
look at verbs." I have no idea what statistics she is reporting
here--although she has a github repository online, it appears not to
contain any of the code used to generate these tables. [^3]

But while Da's method is obscure, I am confident that the interpretation
any reader would take from this-- that Jockers and Kiriloff report
statistically inflated claims of difference-- is incorrect. A simple way
to test the robustness here is just to apply a Dunning Log-Likelihood
test, and use a close analogue to the Bonferroni correction Da calls for
and then never runs, a Holm-Sidak correction. [^4] The result: 81% of
the words Jockers and Kiriloff look at are statistically significant.

After spending a paragraph and a half throwing out statistical claims
that

My intellectual disagreement, here, is with the

{#piper-on-confessions}
## Piper on Confessions

This same slapdash method--mis-stating the statistical or computational
literature, failing to run the very tests she insists are necessary, and
then leaving the reader with the impression she has somehow invalidated
the result--is on prime display in her description of Andrew Piper's
work on the confessional form. Da pulls statistical pronouncements out
of thin air and presents them as that which _must_ be done. These claims
are often either misinformed or misleading.

I can't bear to go through all her sections. But as an example, take the
analysis of Andrew Piper's work on Augustine's _Confessions_. In a few
paragraph, she makes as many mistakes as she holds him to account for in
a full article.

First, she criticizes Piper for performing Principal Components Analysis
on unscaled word frequencies, and produces scatterplots that show
dramatically different results from his: "The way to properly scale this
type of matrix is outlined in G. Casella et al'sÂ Introduction to
Statistical Learning... The second step \[Z-scaling\] is necessary if
each word is to be seen as a feature for PCA." George Casella did not
write a book called _Introduction to Statistical Learning_; she means
the 2013 volume by Gareth James et al.Â published (after Casella's death)
in a Springer series for which he was general editor. The chapter she
cites certainly does not say that PCA matrices must always be scaled by
standard deviations. It says, rather that scaling PCA is a consideration
the researcher should take. When units are arbitrary, PCA should be
scaled--if comparing SAT scores to grade point averages, you don't want
the difference between a 1420 and a 1421 on the test to be the same as a
2.5 and a 3.5 on the GPA. But word frequencies are not arbitrary. In
those cases, the researcher must decide. To quote from the text: "In
certain settings, however, the variables may be measured in the same
units. In this case, we might not wish to scale the variables to have
standard deviation one before performing
PCA."@james\_introduction\_2013.

This is a central challenge familiar to anyone who has tried to grapple
with wordcounts. There are so many uncommon words used once or twice in
any given text that, when scaling is used, they can completely swamp the
repeated words. A variety of solutions are in common use. TF-IDF scaling
drops out the most common words while allowing those of medium frequency
to shine through; log transformations of various flavors proliferate.
Ideally solutions would not be wholly dependent on the parameter space,
but the phrasing of the question matters.

Da sidesteps these all these complications for her reqaders by implying
the real difference has to do with a _philological_ failing, that Piper
doesn't stem Latin text. This is something a literary audience can
understand, and gestures towards a humanistic critique. But comically,
her version reproduces many of the same philological failings. She
implies that Piper didn't use a Latin stemming algorithm because the
"only Latin stemmer available is the Schinke stemmer," but that she
_has_ taken the effort. This is incorrect on both fronts. First, there
are many Latin stemmers available. (For an in-depth analysis of at least
6, see [Patrick Burn's
work](https://github.com/diyclassics/lemmatizer-experiments/tree/master/notebooks).

And her effort seems to be scattershot at best. It's hard to tell what
code Da actually ran--the [online
appendices](https://github.com/nan-da/Novel-Devotions) for analyzing
Piper's case only include the PCA code for Chinese, not the figures
included in the appendix. (Ordinarily I would be forgiving of this kind
of lapse, which is all too common; perhaps the inadequate code
appendices are intended as a higher-order critique of computational
work. But her failings vis-a-vis replication are far greater than those
of, say, Ted Underwood, who generally supplies a single script called
`replicate.py` that you can run yourself inside any of his projects.)

Still, from what she has posted
[online](https://github.com/nan-da/Novel-Devotions), Da appears to have
re-implemented Schinke's algorithm in both R and python, with separate
rules for nouns and verbs. But then, in her Cross Distance code, she
simply applies the noun stemming rules to all words, (probably) because
choosing a part of speech is much harder than running stemming. This
results in many problems; both because some verbs are not stemmed at all
('resurrexit' remains 'resurrexit' even though the verb rules would have
it as 'resurrexi'); and because the rules are applied to function words
as well with silent NULL results in her code, so that words like 'que,'
'cum,' 'te,' and 'me' are deleted from the text altogether. That is:
many function words are being dropped altogether because a new
implementation was hastily coded rather than using one of the more
mature implementations available.

I wrote this and then, quickly, checked what difference it all makes.
(Code and edits online
[here](https://github.com/bmschmidt/Novel-Devotions/blob/master/Checking.Rmd))
I was, honestly, expecting that the scaling factor would be significant
and account for the differences in texts. But actually, what I got looks
more or less like Piper's original.

Or maybe it looks completely unlike it\!

{#and-so-on}
## And so on.

I could go on. The debunking of topic model, for example, uses not the
well established literature about comparing topic model distributions to
each other, but some arbitrarily chosen robustness tests. (It drops 1%
of documents). But it is not a replication. Topic models rely on
extremely specific assumptions about the distribution of words in texts
based on word counts; they attempt to reproduce the frequencies in
actual documents.

But rather than fit on word counts, the model, for no apparent reason,
[uses TF-IDF
vectors](https://github.com/nan-da/Quiet-Transformations/blob/master/lda_fitting.py#L60-L64)
that multiply the significance of rare words and decrease the
significance of common ones. I have never seen a TF-IDF vectorization
fed into an LDA feature set before-- it's an extremely odd choice that
guarantees the results will be different from Underwood and Goldstone's,
and partially explains the incoherent topics in the appendix, such as
`doulce attractiveness unsatisfying gence dater following mecum wigan cio milieu`.
(Edit 03-20) I'm wrong about this: Andrew Goldstone points out that
there's an argument to the TFIDF vectorizer in her codes that makes it
output raw frequencies. Frequencies might still produce results
different than the counts that Underwood and Goldstone used, but this is
not a howler. It's still unreasonable, though, to expect that the topics
put out by the Variational Bayes, online LDA implementation in
scikit-learn will be the same as those in the Gibbs-Sampling method
Underwood and Golstone use from Mallet. Different methods can produce
dramatically different results when the hyperparameters are not properly
tuned. ([See
here](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~uai2009/papers/UAI2009_0243_1a80458f5db72411c0c1e392f7dbbc48.pdf))
While [Goldstone
does](https://github.com/agoldst/dfrtopics/blob/master/R/model.R#L282-L2840)
optimize hyperparameters there's nothing in the scikit-learn code that
indicates this effort. So the models may be radically different because
Underwood and Goldstone ran a better model.

In fact, Goldstone and Underwood's [original work on
this](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/what-can-topic-models-of-pmla-teach-us-by-ted-underwood-and-andrew-goldstone/)
dealt with this issue very clearly:

> On the other hand, to say that two models "look substantially
> different" isn't to say that they're incompatible. A jigsaw puzzle cut
> into 100 pieces looks different from one with 150 pieces. If you
> examine them piece by piece, no two pieces are the same --- but once
> you put them together you're looking at the same picture.

This comparison obviously mislabels its bins (it claims that her
replication found the "she killed" and "he wept" are gender stereotypes,
rather than the opposite) and makes some extremely fishy claims such as
"Overall, the percentage differences between these top most correlated
verbs for each gender was very low (0.031% to 0.307%) meaning that while
a difference can be found, male/female is not very differentiated from
one another if we look at verbs." I don't know what that range is
supposed to be, but at least for 'wept', [Google Ngrams gives the
difference in gender usage as
400%](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%28she+cried%2Fshe+_VERB_%29%2F%28he+cried%2Fhe+_VERB_%29&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28she%20cried%20/%20she%20_VERB_%29%20/%20%28he%20cried%20/%20he%20_VERB_%29%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2C(she%20cried%20%2F%20she%20_VERB_)%20%2F%20(he%20cried%20%2F%20he%20_VERB_)%3B%2Cc0)

But to go through all of this is a pain. I'm sure others have written
other analyses. This work is tedious, which is the reason that it's
rarely done; and it's hard to reproduce another workflow even when it's
well-documented.

[^1]: For the record, I myself made a quick check using yet another
    measure of entropy, compressibility; I'm inclined to think Da is
    right that there is a fundamental error Stanford's bigram
    calculations.

[^2]: Nearest shrunken centroids is indeed a sort of idiosyncratic
    choice, but one that Jockers seems to be extremely partial to going
    back over a decade. @jockers\_comparative\_2008. Whether digital
    humanists should be free to roam across the disciplines in search of
    obscure but useful algorithms, or should remain in a tightly
    constrained space, is a difficult one. My stance--

[^3]: I base this partly because the appendix says it uses the "SpaCy"
    packages for results, but none of her online code imports that
    package.

[^4]: I am not a statistician, but I use the Sidak correction because
    the literature seems to say it's [superior
    to](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~dgroppe/STATZ/Abdi-Bonferroni2007-pretty.pdf)
    the Bonferroni. I use the Holm modification, which applies
    increasingly stringent standards as you descend a list, because of
    an issue Da doesn't ever address, type II errors; that it is as
    incorrect to report a false negative as a false positive. I order
    the Holm method is by word frequency, not p-value (suggested in some
    online literature) to make the test more conservative; since Jockers
    and Kiriloff use the 310 most common words, there's no need to worry
    about multiple comparisons outside this range.
