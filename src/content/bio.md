Benjamin Schmidt is a Clinical Associate Professor of History and Director of
Digital Humanities at New York University.
His research interests are in the digital humanities and the intellectual and
cultural history of the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries.
His digital humanities research focuses on large-scale text analysis,
humanities data visualization, and the challenges and opportunities of

and re-analysis of historical data. He also contributes to popular
conversations on topics including higher education in the United States,
computational detection of anachronisms in historical fiction, and the
“crisis” of the humanities.
