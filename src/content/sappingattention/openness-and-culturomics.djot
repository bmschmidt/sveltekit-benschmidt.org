The [Culturomics authors released a
FAQ](http://www.culturomics.org/Resources/faq) last week that responds
to many of the questions floating around about their project. I should,
by trade, be most interested in their responses to the lack of humanist
involvement. I'll get to that in a bit. But instead, I find myself
thinking more about what the requirements of openness are going to be
for textual research.

That issue is deeply tied to some two-cultures questions about just what
openness means. [Matthew
Jockers](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CC4QFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stanford.edu%2F%7Emjockers%2Fcgi-bin%2Fdrupal%2Fnode%2F53&ei=v3E0TY7iKML38AaIkKWZCQ&usg=AFQjCNFQ67Tk-aYDaKiSIqB0IxT3vxQ0oQ&sig2=UBhBgb2M7R0qWZZ6h0X25w)
and [Ted
Underwood](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftedunderwood.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F12%2F30%2Fhow-to-make-the-google-dataset-work-for-humanists%2F&ei=_XE0Td7CLsOC8gbv5pjaCA&usg=AFQjCNFiyFunLm_48rINAaBxy9DGALBnDw&sig2=SW_KjPslAavYhVs6Q7QvqA)
have been calling for a full release of the list of books behind the
ngrams dataset. Culturomics (that's as clear as I can be on authorship,
unfortunately) says they "have not received permission" yet to release
the list of 5.2m books behind the set. I assume that's because Google's
metadata is [subject to proprietary restrictions from catalog
aggregators](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2010/12/todays-times-article.html)
and publishers---it will be interesting to see how they get out of that.
Depending on what's in the metadata and its release format, that could
range from barely readable to quite interesting.

On the other hand, as Culturomics points out, they have been commendably
open with the ngrams data. They do far more than historians would have
(I suspect) to make their experiments easily replicable, and their pages
seem to indicate a plan to release more and more better cleaned data as
time goes on. They seem to view the repository of data they're setting
up as a field-changing contribution that will drive research in the
quantitative study of culture. Files of the magnitude they're putting
out are only possible for a very few organizations. Google is certainly
the best positioned of those. If so, they're right to be so proud of
their openness, and they're also right to have put that ahead of the
bibliography. Cleaning and tokenizing textual data is a dreary task with
enormous returns to scale, and if everyone needs basically the same
dataset, research can move ahead faster with it even before the exact
details are known.

But then again: _if everyone needs the same dataset._ That's a huge
caveat, and it certainly isn't completely true. Some people want
part-of-speech tagging on a representative corpus, and they'll want
[COHA](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorpus.byu.edu%2Fcoha%2Fcompare-culturomics.asp&ei=hVk3TfX0Koyr8AbR0bHQAw&usg=AFQjCNFuB3oXm33jtu8ZMkVIXu-8dslYIw&sig2=tI5LEqnSrJ4EeJwQYmh9eA)
or its descendants. Some people want very precisely edited texts of
relatively canonical works, and they'll use MONK or WordHoard with the
highly edited and tagged texts that come out of what Martin Mueller is
[calling](https://nuconfluence.northwestern.edu/display/%7Emmueller/Repetitions+in+Early+Modern+Drama)
digital lower criticism. Part of what happened when Culturomics came out
to somewhat reserved enthusiasm is that the people interested in
computer textual analysis---who already have systems in place and a
clear idea of their needs---quickly realized that it didn't do what they
needed, and that for many tasks (comparing versions of the folios? full
part of speech tagging?), it might never make it.

At the same time, there are a lot of humanists who are still unclear on
what, if anything, they can get out of lexical statistics. Some found
ngrams eye-opening; some just found it
[fun](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CBwQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnataliacecire.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F12%2Fgoogle-books-ngrams-and-number-of-words.html&ei=hmk3TbKPO8Sp8AaQ3aCYBA&usg=AFQjCNHU2BUuBWCEGGC3AorHwrgcfC6sLw&sig2=aYCgSvwRKdWKtVT1_TsZAQ);
and some, I think, were put off a bit. First, by the scientific
packaging; and second, by the lack of traditional humanist niceties like
a bibliography, or some historiography, or a clear phrasing of what
existing problems ngrams will solve. Since all humanists, by union
contract, own the exact same 2008 white MacBook I have, most couldn't do
anything much with the gigabytes of text files offered for download. You
certainly can't open it with Excel to find what you want---even to get a
basic wordcount for a span of years basically requires some sort of
[program](http://www.princeton.edu/%7Ebschmidt/ngrams.pl). Casual
humanists would probably be happier with less openness and more
clarity---[too much
information](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/06/08/how-goldman-deals-with-the-government/)
can seem like a way of stonewalling, particularly when the information
you most want isn't necessarily there. In any case, what they didn't
necessarily get is a sense of the immediate applicability to live
questions in the humanities.

That's because, in part, of the different types of openness. The
openness of the sciences is based around replicability of experiments
with relatively constrained goals; whereas currently, no one knows just
what we're headed for in the humanities. (Particularly in history, which
I promise a lot more aboutÂ  later.) The openness of culturomics will let
a thousand flowers bloom, but only in one type of research. Of course
there will be other types: but the combined cultural capital of the
route this project (Harvard-Google-_Science_-_New York Times_) makes it
important to be clear that the release of centralized datasets, a la
genomics, is not _the_ long-term solution to allowing digital history.

I should be equally clear, though, that it is _a_ long-term
solution---some sort of baseline data is incredibly useful for all sorts
of textual analysis, and whatever Google provides will probably be the
best we get. I've had a little trouble so far figuring out how to use
the Culturomics data to clean up my own dataset (largely because I don't
want to adopt their ways of using capitalization and apostrophes for
memory-saving reasons) but with a larger dataset, those sorts of
problems should melt away. As they role out some more sets of genres
with better metadata, it will provide an amazing group of genre
baselines for comparison of more localized texts.

But given the limitations of ngrams (using the word generically) data, I
tend to think that data's usefulness will rest not only in its openness
a la genomics, but in its ability to complement other datasources. If
Google ngrams is the best solution we can come up with for linking book
metadata to textual data, we are going to be largely restricted to the
studies of fame and repression in 'culture' that the culturomists have
been releasing so far---studies that don't get to the core of most of
the historiography which rely on a lot of different ways of thinking
about how the web of language intersects at various levels.

Openness in the digital humanities needs to be about _interoperability_
as well as _replicability._ Ngrams is stellar on the second, and merely
good on the first. Moving forward, I wonder how we can do better.

I think that's all I really have to say for now aside from a couple
reflections about copyright I'll post in a bit. But I should put up
their response to the problem of lack of humanistic involvement in their
project that I [worried
about](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2010/12/missing-humanists.html),
though I wasn't the
[first](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/books/17words.html?pagewanted=2)
(nor was Menand, I'm sure):

When I was researching a section of the [Humanities
Indicators](http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/) about the "Humanities
Workforce," one of the priorities was to be inclusive about the range of
occupations---editors, secondary teachers, journalists, not to mention
archivists, librarians, museum curators---who were professional
humanists without a research university chair. There's no bright line,
and that's good. I certainly don't want to write anyone out
peremptorily.
