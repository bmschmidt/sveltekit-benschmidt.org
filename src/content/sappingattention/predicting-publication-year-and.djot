title: Predicting publication year and generational language shift
url: /2011/05/predicting-publication-year-and.html
---

Before end-of-semester madness, I was looking at how shifts in
vocabulary usage occur. In many cases, I found, vocabulary change
doesn't happen evenly across across all authors. Instead, it can happen
generationally; older people tend to use words at the rate that was
common in their youth, and younger people anticipate future word
patterns. An eighty-year-old in 1880 uses a world like "outside" more
like a 40-year-old in 1840 than he does like a 40-year-old in 1880. [The
original
post](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/04/age-cohort-and-vocabulary-use.html)
has a more detailed explanation.

Will had some some good questions in the comments about how different
words fit these patterns. Looking at different types of words should
help find some more ways that this sort of investigation is interesting,
and show how different sorts of language vary. But to look at other
sorts of words, I should be a little clearer about the kind of words I
chose the first time through. If I can describe the usage pattern for a
"word like 'outside'," just what kind of words are like 'outside'? Can
we generalize the trend that they demonstrate?

Most of the words I chose last time came out of the results of a
[principal components analysis I did
earlier](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/02/pca-on-years.html)
to see how vocabulary usage changed over time. That result gave me back
a particular kind of word---those that change slowly but steadily over
time. The [Google ngram for
'outside'](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=outside&year_start=1830&year_end=1922&corpus=0&smoothing=3)
shows a steady rise: it also finds [several
words](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=prudent%2Cacknowledged%2Cnotwithstanding%2Cdisposed%2Crendered%2Ccommencement%2Ccircumstance%2Cmode&year_start=1830&year_end=1922&corpus=0&smoothing=3)
with a steady decline. (Reminder: I'm not using the ngrams data for [my
own
analysis](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/02/technical-notes.html),
but it serves as a nice check to use a different set to confirm trends I
find where that dataset is usable).

That's to say: these are distinctive words I use. They represent a very
particular sort of change in language; it happens slowly, creepingly,
and probably without much notice by historical actors. It even happens,
I think, without much notice by historians: we tend to care about words
that are contentious, that represent major changes, and as a result they
tend to have spikes and plateaus. Some historical keywords do have some
[nice overall
trend](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=evolution%2C+liberty&year_start=1830&year_end=1922&corpus=5&smoothing=3);
but [plenty of
others](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=pragmatism%2Cwhigs%2CJoseph+Smith&year_start=1830&year_end=1922&corpus=5&smoothing=2)
tremble up, down, and steady.

Our standard ways of writing about causation in the historical
profession deal worst, in some ways, with decades-long steady change:
there will not be any single useful archival source to write about the
long creep upwards of a word like outside, while there may be single
people or institutions that themselves propel "Joseph Smith" or
"Pragmatism" into common usage. (I think English and Comp Lit may
actually have a better vocabulary for describing these long shifts not
necessarily tied to individual people; Ted Underwood is doing some [neat
stuff looking at century-long patterns in language
use](http://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/the-history-of-an-association-part-two/)
on his blog, for example.) In some ways, that's just what's exciting
about using computers to help read books: these are shifts in language
over the _longue dur√©e,_ and they open up new prospects for being quite
precise (perhaps misleadingly so) in describing changes that previously
might have been murky or unknown. More on that later, hopefully. Also, I
should deal more concretely with many of the other words we care about.

But first, let me take advantage of steady directional drift in language
to think about how it helps us in identifying when books were written. I
was talking to Jamie recently about dating anonymous Latin hagiographies
from the 6th-8th centuries based on their word usage. This is something
that we might be able to do fairly well with computers. (I'm sure
there's a bit of research out there that I haven't read, actually). I
could probably make some headway with the open library database. A full
non-linear regression on publication year using all 200,000 words I have
would be a major project, and I don't see an immediate payoff for it.
But one of the nice things about the pca analysis I did is that it
breaks 10,000 words down to five or six dimensions that I know correlate
to publication year. The data is already selected to be linear, so
normal linear regression should work too.

That means I can build up a simple linear model that, given the
vocabulary usage of a book, makes a guess as to when it was published.
To help it out, since I know [some genres lag behind the times and
others ahead (second chart in linked
page)](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/02/genres-in-motion.html),
I give it catalog number information as a variable to work with as well.
The result accurately places somewhat more than half the books within a
decade of their actual publication date. (R-squared = .56). I could
certainly build a better model, but don't need one right now: this is a
good enough for the particular sort of slow, steady change that I've
been looking at, and all the error should be smoothed out in the end
anyway.

I'll forgo too much exploration of that model, since it's not my main
focus here. (It does include some neat features, like the ability to
find the most futuristic books in any given genre). But let me make a
couple quick, eminently skippable notes with scatter plots to explore
the error here. First, the overall error. Remember, I'm using
publication year, which includes reprints, because I don't trust the
metadata very much on first publication year. The model almost never
mispredicts by more than 50 years.

[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yYNcYOCosbA/Tcl5snNBdRI/AAAAAAAACxk/4RrM7aqP8TE/s1600/full+error+plot.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yYNcYOCosbA/Tcl5snNBdRI/AAAAAAAACxk/4RrM7aqP8TE/s1600/full+error+plot.png)

Basically all this chart below shows is that most books are written by
people under 100 years old, but I have a few very old authors. The
streak around 350 years old is Shakespeare, whose books are consistently
predicted as published in the 1880s or so. That's somewhat
interesting---it means that a sample based on vocabulary from 1830 to
1922 is terrible at extrapolating out much past those boundaries.

Let's zoom in to the section of the plot with realistically aged authors
and fewer than fifty years of worth of error.

[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vF25lYnXKNU/Tcl5sAINO-I/AAAAAAAACxg/G2aATbbDfxs/s1600/relevant+error+plot.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vF25lYnXKNU/Tcl5sAINO-I/AAAAAAAACxg/G2aATbbDfxs/s1600/relevant+error+plot.png)

We can see that most of the error is not due to author age. It takes a
computer to really notice the slight downward slant in the scatter (R =
--0.21). That's telling us that author age doesn't explain the bulk of
missing data, but that it might help some. A better model might explain
some of the other variation.

This model, though, is good enough to explore the variations in some of
my data. Last post, I looked at how percentage usage of words changed
over time: now I can look at how _predicted year_ changes over time:

[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hPUbVWz2bGA/TclOHdsJWwI/AAAAAAAACxc/gorbkqowgHM/s1600/predicted+year+of+publication+by+age.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hPUbVWz2bGA/TclOHdsJWwI/AAAAAAAACxc/gorbkqowgHM/s1600/predicted+year+of+publication+by+age.png)

For each combination of year and author age, the colors show what year
my model thinks the books in that position were written. Let's take
books written in 1880 as example. On average, it thinks books by 30
year-olds written in 1880 were written around 1897; books by 50
year-olds look to it like they were written in 1891; and books by
70-year olds look like they were written in 1875. To go back to the
language of my last post, an Angstrom theory of language would have 0
years of change for 40 years of age difference, and a Bascombe theory
would have 40 years of change; this basically splits the difference with
22 years of predicted difference in the language of different aged
authors. You can see that more generally in the slope of the lines
towards the northeast; they aren't horizontal (Angstrom) but neither do
they match up with the diagonal aging lines (Bascombe).

So that means that of language change, half is because of generational
displacement, and half because of individuals learning new words as the
get older. (The extra two years towards Bascombe (22 instead of 20),
let's just pretend, are because of the relatively few republished books
in the sample). That sounds about right to me. I felt like I might have
somewhat oversold the aging component in my previous post, because I
think it's more important to notice that it's there. To say it's about
half of all steady change in language (which, I should note, is not all
change in language) means that it's pretty important.

That, I think, more firmly establishes how important generational
displacement is in driving linguistic change. I think there are still
some productive questions to be asked about these charts, though, that
get beyond that basic point. Here are some, from most to least
technical.

1. How can we describe whether a word is type-Angstrom or type-Bascombe
   without having to eyeball these heat maps? With the results from the
   linear model, it's easy to just look at slope. But most of the heat
   maps are a lot more splotchy--they don't simply run in a straight
   line. I think I could kludge together an approach that works off of
   the slope of contour lines; that might be good enough.
2. The Bascombe-Angstrom model I described only includes countour lines
   running in two of the four cardinal directions. I'm pretty confident
   that most words should fall roughly between those two models, but
   there are other possibilities nonetheless. I talked a little last
   time about words that remain constant in usage across time, but vary
   in usage by different age groups; Willy asked in the comments about
   the fourth kind, where changes begin among older people and then
   filter down into the younger generations. I suspect there are very
   few words like that (although 'evolution', actually, is close). Am I
   right? What are those words, if they do exist?
3. What other aggregations tell us things about whether generations or
   intrasubjective shifts drive linguistic changes? I'd like to bring
   some of my genre data into this mess, perhaps, to see if young people
   drive shifts towards new disciplines or if it generally requires
   oldsters to lead the way. Or keeping it at the linguistic level, I
   wonder how shifts in the prevalence of topic-model generated topics
   over time correspond to changing ages.
4. To what degree are generalizable claims I can make about the role of
   generational displacement in linguistic change universal patterns,
   and to what degree are they an artifact of the particular historical
   period I'm looking at? I've been mulling over [this New Yorker
   cartoon](http://www.newyorkerstore.com/april-25-2011/when-i-was-your-age-things-were-exactly-the-way-they-are-now/invt/136958/).
   Let's say it's right, and at one point there was no linguistic
   change. Once it started, did generational displacement immediately
   start driving half of it? Or was it across all generations at first?
   This would take a lot of data I don't have (and that might not exist
   in sufficient numbers before the 18th century or so, and that's
   locked inside copyright for the post-1922 period). But there are some
   neat ways I can think of to ask the question.
5. Finally---so what? What's the context for shifts in language we
   haven't noticed before, and how important is the difference between
   generational change and intrasubjective change? I think it says a
   lot, but I haven't quite articulated what sort of explanatory
   theoretical framework I think these descriptive changes are evidence
   for. That's worth doing.

Regarding the question of different drivers of linguistic change (#4 and
5): in the case of early medieval Francia, Carolingian linguistic
reforms were evident earliest in texts produced with close connections
to the court. We used to assume that the language reform had immediate
and total effect on the textual record, so this observation has been an
important qualification; but it still reflects the kind of
intrasubjective change you mentioned that is easy for historians to
identify because it maps onto the familiar analytics of power and other
kinds of social relationships.

But as Roger Wright pointed out a few decades ago, the Carolingian
language reforms were also engineered by non-native speakers from
England. That observation recast what had once been seen as a
restoration of the correct classical style into the more negative
conclusion that the reforms were artificial and precipitated the split
between Latin and what would eventually become French.

All this is to say that a generational view of linguistic transformation
has political as well as social implications. A new way of viewing
change that's gradual and possibly unoffensive could soften the moral
charge that so frequently accompanies discussion of changes in language.
Or the discovery that linguistic change was, in fact, propelled by one
overzealous age bracket could give more texture to the more traditional
ways of explaining the capacity to influence.

Someone else posted a comment here that got lost, I think, when Blogger
went down for a few days.

I think determining that usage changes about half through generational
succession, and half through a kind of collective drift, is a really
fundamental and important result. You might consider some way of drawing
this to the attention of people in historical linguistics.

When I took historical linguistics back in grad school, we focused
heavily on phonology. In the case of phonology, the consensus is that
change happens almost entirely through generational succession, and
specifically through errors made by new language-learners. I suspect
historical linguists have made similar efforts to think about semantic
change, but I doubt they've studied usage from this statistical angle.

I also just want to underline your point that we don't really have good
ways of thinking about slow, long-term changes. Although I appreciate
your kind reference to my blog, I would say that is on the whole as much
of a problem in literary studies as it is in History. Literary scholars
get deeply invested in periodization, which plays the institutional role
for us that "area" plays for historians (it organizes hiring,
publication, etc.) And that emphasis on period actually makes it pretty
hard to talk about long, slow changes -- the disciplinary payoff isn't
immediately clear.
