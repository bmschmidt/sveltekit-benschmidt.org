The hardest thing about studying massive quantities of digital texts is
knowing just what texts you have. This is knowlege that we haven't been
particularly good at collecting, or at valuing.

The post I wrote two years ago about the Google Ngram chart for 02138
(the zip code for Cambridge, MA) remains a touchstone for me because it
shows the ways that materiality, copyright, and institutional decisions
can produce data artifacts that are at once inscrutable and completely
understandable. (Here's the chart--[go read the original post for the
explanation](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/01/digital-history-and-copyright-black.html).)\

Since then, I've talked a lot about the need to understand both the
[classification schemes for individual
libraries](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/02/fresh-set-of-eyes.html),
and the need to understand the [complicated historical provenance of the
digital sources we
use](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2012/10/logbooks-and-long-history-of.html).

What I haven't done is give a real account of the sources of the books
in Bookworm. That's pretty hypocritical. I apologize. I decided some
time ago to use the Open Library to provide all the metadata for
Bookworm. It has very good, high-quality library metadata; but it
_doesn't_ indicate where the metadata, or the volume itself, came from.
(The meta-metadata, if you will, is not great.) That's an ontological
issue. Open Library describes "editions," so there's no space for a
field that tells you where an individual pdf or text volume came from.

I recently loaded in this library data, though. The Internet Archive web
site, which stores the actual books, _does_ say where a particular
volume comes from. So with a little behind the scenes magic, it's pretty
easy to get that into the database in some form.

I've been learning some D3 mock up a possible multi-dimensional
interfaces to the Bookworm data through the API. (If you come to the
Bookworm booth at the DPLA meeting next month, you can play with this as
well as some new projects others in the lab have been building on the
platform).

Using that, it's possible to quickly mock up a chart of the...
(drumroll)...

*Library origins of the books in Bookworm. (Most common libraries only)*

The colors are on a log scale here, and each little line represents a
single combination of a library and year. So a red horizontal band is an
area where a library has contributed hundreds of books to the Internet
Archive (and therefore Bookworm) each year, a yellow to orange band
means dozens of books a year, and the areas of scattered green show
libraries that only contribute a volume or two every few years. I only
show the most common libraries.

What can we see here? The number one contributor is the University of
California Libraries. (No surprise). The Â Robarts library at the
University of Toronto is number two--that's only surprising to me
because there have been so few books published in Canada when I've
segmented by country. Most of the other large libraries are the ones you
would expect\_---\_both some of the big university/Google partner
libraries (Harvard, Oxford, Michigan, NYPL) and a few free agents who
scanned on their own or in cooperation with the Internet Archive
(Library of Congress, Boston Public (I think)).

The temporal patterns are more interesting. The 1922 cutoff line is the
dominant visual feature of the chart--the extremely different
composition of the lending libraries after that date (MIT and Montana
State suddenly become important players, while sources like Cal and the
LOC vanish). This is why comparisons across 1922 are never safe, even
when the numbers seem big enough. But the complicated nature of the
copyright line and scanning policies is also clear: for Canadiana.org,
it's 1900, and for Oxford, it seems to be in the 1880s. There are
clearly some metadata problems, as well (I think a lot of those
post-1922 Harvard books are misattributed).

There are also a lot of strange little clusters of intense collection.
Duke and the Lincoln Financial collection have massive spikes from about
1861-1865; the Boston Public Library seems to have an abnormal number of
books right around 1620 and 1776. Those are specifically historical
collections that will affect the sort of conclusions one can draw from
aggregate data, [much like the questions I was asking about a Google
presentation](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2012/07/do-revolutionaries-really-read-history.html)
that purported to show that more history was published in revolutionary
times). Although oddly enough, the first few BPL volumes from 1620 I
checked were in French or Latin--it's not quite the model of founding
charters that I expected.

The digital libraries we're building are immense patchworks. That means
they have seams. It's possible to tell stories that rest lightly across
the many elements. But push too hard in the wrong direction, and
conclusions can unravel. I don't think that any conclusions I've made in
the past are unsettled by knowing where the books came from--although
that Oxford dropoff has me wondering what might happen to transatlantic
comparisons. But I'm glad to be able to see it, and so wanted to share.
This is something we need to do.

And this isn't an issue particular to just Bookworm, although it does
have a slightly more tangled line of transmission than some other
libraries. Here, for example, are the top 16 libraries in the Hathi
trust catalog from 1780 to 1820, scraped from their web catalog. 1800 is
not a year that dramatically changes the publication history of books;
but it is a year that librarians will use for their own arbitrary
purposes. For instance, a book published in 1799 is considerably more
likely to have been "rare" and therefore off limits to the Google
scanners in the period of book scanning, I'd bet anything, just because
human beings use rules of thumb like that; or in the period that
university libraries were being built, acquisition policies may have
been quite different for pre-1800 vs post-1800 texts in various genres.
("Don't buy any science books written before 1800" would be a sensible
policy to adopt in 1870, for example. Almost all the libraries here
would not have bought the bulk of their 1799 collections in the year
1799.)

I pulled out the year 1800 (1800 and 1900 are both massive spikes where
all sorts of unknown books can be filed). That also serves to highlight
the gaps from 1799 to 1801; they're sometimes quite significant. What
you see here are the same sort of seams and discontinuities as in
Bookworm, albeit on a smaller scale. The number of volumes from NYPL,
Cal, and Harvard double overnight; other libraries, like Michigan and
Madrid, seem not to show any pattern. If Michigan and California collect
different sorts of books, this can cause major headaches for comparisons
across the line.

## There's no grand lesson here. Or if there is, it's just the old one:
know your sources. But as a public service announcement, it's worth
making again and again.
