Here's a fun way of using this dataset to convey a lot of historical
information. I took all the 414 words that end in ism in my database,
and plotted them by the year in which they peaked,\* with the size
proportional to their use at peak. I'm going to think about how to make
it flashier, but it's pretty interesting as it is. Sample below, and
full chart after the break.

The x-axis doesn't mean anything, and the years are jittered a little to
make it easier to read. If I ever get this database running quickly
enough to use, I'd love to color-code the words by machine-categorized
field (science, religion, politics, etc.). Any other ideas for
additional information this could show?

## \*Actually the year in which a fitted loess curve peaked. I turned up
the sensitivity of the loess curve because it gave better results for a
few words (knownothingism, in particular) that were intensely used for
only a few years and then at a lower level of use later.

So does this tell us that the number of "-isms" rises steadily over the
century, or does it not tell us that? How do these relate to their
associated "-ists," or is that too hard to figure out?

The increased density of 'isms' in the teens shows that they did
increase over time.

It would be pretty easy to add the 'ists,' although there would be false
positives and negatives: there's no such thing as a utilitarianist, and
an organist is not a follower of organized organism.

Can we select a few to track though? I'd be interested in disparities
between "sociology" and "sociologist," for example, as well as
"Darwinism," "Darwinist," and "Darwinian"...

Ben, just now coming onto your site, great work--I'm struck by the
persistence of religious denominations as the featured "isms" into the
end of the 19C. They're placed by the peak and the font size is by the
number of hits at peak, you mention--is this in absolute terms, or is it
weighted by number of publications per year? So this makes the graph
heavy in the 20thC, no?

Scott,

Good catch, I misspoke on the labels--it's weighted by the percentage of
books in the year of peak. So these do represent some change.

I couldn't say for sure, but it looks to me like the religious words
that peak later are often ones with more historical import---puritanism,
calvinism? I've been meaning to take the clustering tree of these words
and try color-coding them from that, which might shed light on whether
different groups of religious terms peak at different times. (Though
there's a little chicken-egg problem here--they'll be classed as
different groups in part \_because\_ they peak at different times).

There may be a little of error pushing things towards the back since my
corpus isn't perfectly curated--I still have to cull out a bunch of
improperly maintained foreigh-language books, for instance, and those
might be clustered towards the beginning. There are various other
problems. But I think all that clustering at the end is real
