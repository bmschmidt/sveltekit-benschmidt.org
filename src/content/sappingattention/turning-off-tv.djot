I'm starting up a new blog,
Qwikster[Prochronism](http://www.prochronism.com/) (an obscure
near-synonym for 'anachronism') for anything I want to post aboutÂ 
TV/movie related anachronisms and historical language. There are two new
posts up there right now: on the [season premiere of Mad
Men](http://www.prochronism.com/2012/04/mad-men-returns.html) and
[Sunday's night's
episode](http://www.prochronism.com/2012/04/mad-men-3-get-off-phone.html).

People are interested in TV anachronisms, and I find the patterns it
unveils really interesting for understanding language change. (A lot of
my dissertation research focuses on just the sort of below-the-radar
language changes). But I made this blog for working with large textual
sources and posting occasional off-the-cuff rants about digital
humanities, and the posts have gotten longer with time. I don't want
swamp it with too much about television. Minor week-by-week rundowns of
Mad Men would fall under that category, as would random Deadwood
visualizations and a bunch of other things I have sitting around and may
want to dole out.

I think we could have a mildly interesting discussion about the role of
TV and film criticism in the digital humanities, which retains a bit of
stodginess about its subject matter in order to secure acceptance for
its methodologies. (I tend to think this is a wise bit of strategic
positioning, but am open to the opposite perspective). Though I do have
a fair amount of early broadcasting history in my dissertation, I can't
bring myself to do a full-throated defense of writing about TV right now
and passing it up as a somehow academic endeavor--chalk me up as part of
the problem.

## I'll probably follow the [Andrew](http://andrewgelman.com/)
[Gelman](http://www.themonkeycage.org/) model and crosspost on some
things with dual relevance. So whenever I get around to savaging Edith
Wharton for her tin ear in _The Age of Innocence_, it will be here as
well.

Excellent. I look forward in particular to random Deadwood
visualizations\!

If you can tell me how those writers managed to produce a Shakespearean
Western, digital humanities will have triumphed over all other schools
of criticism ever.
