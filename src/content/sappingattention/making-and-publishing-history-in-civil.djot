title: Making and publishing history in the Civil War

A follow up on [my post from yesterday about whether there's more
history published in times of
revolution](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2012/07/do-revolutionaries-really-read-history.html).
I was saying that I thought the dataset Google uses must be counting
documents of historical importance as history: because libraries tend to
shelve in a way that conflates things that are _about_ history and
things that _are_ history.

I realized after posting that the first of the two graphs in [Michael
Witmore and Robin Valenza's post](http://winedarksea.org/?p=1520)
actually shows a spike in publications of US history somewhere near
1860. (It actually looks closer to the late 1850s, but there aren't any
grid lines on the chart.) [Bookworm](http://bookworm.culturomics.org/)
is pretty much useless in the 17th century, but it's on solid ground in
the 1860s. And I've long known there was something funny going in
Bookworm around the Civil War, particularly in the History class.

So--is there more history published in the Civil War period in the
Bookworm database? What kind?

This chart is comparable to the one that Google made, but with fewer
lines and without any aggregation. It shows four LC classifications from
1850 to 1870 by number of books. (It's LC classifications--stack
location--not subject headings, that the original post appears to use.)

You can create pretty much this same chart in Bookworm by searching for
the word 'a'; clicking on the lines around 1860s shows what the books
are. Quite a number are [things like the "Lincoln
Catechism",](http://archive.org/stream/lincolncatechism00newy#page/4/mode/2up)
an election-year grabbag of racial innuendo and hard-currency
absolutism:

> Does the Republican party intend to change the name of the United
> States?\
> It does.\
> What do they intend to call it?\
> New Africa.

Not only is this not history--it's so ephemeral that it probably
wouldn't have made it into the collection if it were about a less
interesting historical period--Grover Cleveland's black baby, say.

[If you click around on Bookworm, you'll find a lot more like
this](http://bookworm.culturomics.org/#?%7B%22counttype%22%3A%22Number_of_Books%22%2C%22smoothingSpan%22%3A0%2C%22search_limits%22%3A%5B%7B%22word%22%3A%5B%22a%22%5D%2C%22lc0%22%3A%5B%22E%22%5D%7D%5D%7D).

Having done that myself, I note one distinguishing feature of these
ephemera: many are quite short, while real works of history tend to be
fairly long. Looking at the lengths of the books confirms that the
lengths of only E (US history) drops significantly in the 1860s:

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_13nXxBmRG8/T_7Wrl9yvWI/AAAAAAAADfU/Y5d5aSpxa94/s640/Which+is+coupled+by+a+sharp+drop+in+length.png)

And if we look at a log-scale histogram of book lengths comparing
1860-1865 book lengths to 1855-59 and 1866-70 lengths, we see an
interesting pattern. In the non-wartime books, there are two nice peaks
around 100,000 and 10,000 words; but in the war, the single peak at
10,000 words is much larger.

[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tQS4lPI8CuA/T_7Wq5xV1eI/AAAAAAAADfM/M_e5Ld4DD8Q/s640/That+length+is+lots+of+shorter+books,+not+a+general+shift.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tQS4lPI8CuA/T_7Wq5xV1eI/AAAAAAAADfM/M_e5Ld4DD8Q/s1600/That+length+is+lots+of+shorter+books,+not+a+general+shift.png)

Some short books are still history--indeed, short books is probably how
you'd respond to an increase in demand. But given the actual texts that
Bookworm shows.

The question then is: does this same pattern apply to the 18th and 17th
century historiography spikes?

One thing I'd note: a lot of the ephemera in Bookworm come from
non-Google scanning projects: the Sloan-funded digitization at the
Library of Congress, particularly, and other random sources. (The
Lincoln catechism is from "the Friends of the Lincoln Financial
Collection in Indiana.") In other words, not the University libraries
that Google digitized.

That's significant because it suggests how difficult it is to count a
'book' at the margins--a lot of the Google estimates about the 'total
number of books ever published' seem to rely on catalog metadata. But
while university libraries tend to be fairly regular in their collecting
patterns, special collections libraries tend to have much stranger
bulges that reflect particular areas of interest--bequests from private
collections, places they went on the auction market, dull campaign
literature they didn't misplace in the 1870s.

My general solution to this is to say that actually, we don't want all
the books ever published--we just want library books to analyze. (If
we're going to analyze any set as a whole). Partially because those
books are interesting in themselves--built to last, probably better
written and more intrinsically interesting--but also because the
historical fact of their preservation, not their innate qualities, tells
us a lot about the slice of society--librarians, educators, and their
donors--who take it upon themselves to preserve books.

## The "history of the library" sounds like an incredibly dull rallying
call compared to the 'history of culture'; but so did the 'history of
the book' compared to the 'history of ideas.' And the former is a lot
more widespread today than the latter, because it can proceed on more
sound grounds.

How embarrassing. Editing to say that what's useful is that their
preservation is what's interesting, not their innate qualities.

Absolutely. Witmore and Valenza's spike around revolutions may be
telling a story about what our libraries have valued over time more than
anything about the revolutionary periods themselves.

Here's an example for the English Civil War (using Michigan's catalog):

http\://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/005668828

General pamphlet, classed in DA with a whole bunch of other pamphlets
(collection record: http\://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/000239399). Most
of these are current events, but will get classed in history. Your
original point, obviously, but I wanted to come up with a concrete
example.

And you are also correct that the original post/graph is using LC
classification not LC subject headings.
