title: Clustering isms together
url: /2010/11/clustering-isms-together.html
---

In addition to finding the [similarities in use between particular
isms](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2010/11/comparing-usage-patterns-across-isms.html),
we can look at their similarities in general. Since we have the
distances, it's possible to create a dendrogram, which is a sort of
family tree. Looking around the literary studies text-analysis blogs, I
see these done quite a few times to classify works by their vocabulary.
I haven't seen much using words, though: but it works fairly well. I
thought it might help answer [Hank's question about the difference
between evolutionism and
darwinism](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2010/11/isms-and-ists.html?showComment=1290192473466#c5151763338867196211),
but, as you'll see, that distinction seems to be a little too fine for
now.

Here's the overall tree of the 400-ish isms, with the words removed,
just to give a sense. We can cut the tree at any point to divide into
however many groups we'd like. The top three branches essentially
correspond to 1) Christian and philosophical terminology, 2) social,
historical, and everything else, and 3) medical and some scientific
terminology.

But you probably want to see the actual words.

We can see a little more detail on any of these chunks. If we cut it up
lower, it often makes quite a bit of sense. If I break it into 41
clusters, for example, so that they will average ten items per cluster,
the largest one looks like this:

[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPH3U0kVm2I/AAAAAAAACOI/WQWqml57PmI/s1600/cluster3.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPH3U0kVm2I/AAAAAAAACOI/WQWqml57PmI/s1600/cluster3.png)

From the top, you can see three sub-clusters; one roughly of Catholic
friends and enemies, one of Protestant ones, and a third that is less
clear but may involve slightly more exotic heresies. The Catholic one
nicely separates words connected to the first millenium---heathenism,
nestorianism, arianism away from more modern movements---jesuitism,
jansenism---although some words involved with the early church
fathers---augustinism, manicheanism---show up in the latter cluster,
presumably because they had more currency. "Sacerdotalism" and
"Ritualism" show up among the Protestant words because they are
important in defining Protestantism by contrast, not
Catholicism---opposites are pulled together by use. There are a lot of
reminders that this is classifying by use, not by meaning--I'd like to
have 'montanism' and 'ultramontanism' closer together, and a number of
other protestant words, particularly those with a stronger role in
American history (Puritanism, Wesleyanism) appear in quite different
clusters. But there's certainly some stuff here. In some other cases, it
turns up discursive spheres quite neatly recognizable:

[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPH6Sc1ce-I/AAAAAAAACOM/iqdkBzq7kOY/s1600/cluster27.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPH6Sc1ce-I/AAAAAAAACOM/iqdkBzq7kOY/s1600/cluster27.png)

[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPKBhgDdBHI/AAAAAAAACOg/Rd9yfroakAg/s1600/unions.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPKBhgDdBHI/AAAAAAAACOg/Rd9yfroakAg/s1600/unions.png)

With a few exceptions (favoritism in the first, opportunism in the
second), it's pretty clear why these words are clustered. But in others,
the connections are somewhat more mystifying:

[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPJt60-7t0I/AAAAAAAACOU/ZVmSchjSBps/s1600/oddball.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TPJt60-7t0I/AAAAAAAACOU/ZVmSchjSBps/s1600/oddball.png)

None of these words are very closely related to each other---see how
they branch off before distance=2, while our big protestant cluster was
all inside 1.5---but they are mostly as close as "trinitarianism" and
"tritheism." The frustrating but important thing is that it's just these
sorts of odd juxtapositions that can spur us in new directions. A
frequent complaint about statistical humanities is that it tells us
nothing we didn't know before. Well, I certainly didn't know before that
there was any connection between transcendentalism and animalism, or
between those two and obscurantism and humanism. There is one. Probably
it's not a historically interesting one among these four--it could have
to with publishers, typos, anything else.

As for evolutionism vs.Â Darwinism, there's not much to separate
them--they appear in different places, but clustered oddly among among
various philosophical terms. Maybe I could make sense of it if I read
the chart more--it's down at the bottom if you want to try.

The isms may not be the best set to use this on. What would be? Some set
of names might be interesting. But the real work might involve a related
set of concepts whose connections are disputed. I've been thinking about
running some kind of a retread of Dan Rodger's "In Search of
Progressivism"article, in which he basically does this same kind of
cluster analysis to various strands in the language of progressive
reform. Limiting the set to books in relevant categories, which would
require some sort of LOC catalog information, and then taking years in
the progressive era, we could see what sort of clustering a naive
computer program does, or even start up a few cluster around words of
social control, reform, etc, and see if we can modify or confirm parts
of his ordering. That's a ways off, though. For now, I'll just dump the
whole tree, in three segments, at the bottom of this post. I'd show the
connection between them, but blogger doesn't let me post that long an
image.

Holy Crap\! My compliments to you for taking on this mammoth task\! Now,
all we need is definitions and a short history of each. LOL\! Somebody
needs to make an app.
