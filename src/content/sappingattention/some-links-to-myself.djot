An FYI, mostly for people following this feed on RSS: I just put up on
my home web site [a post about applications for the Simpsons Bookworm
browser I made](http://benschmidt.org/2014/09/11/simpsons-2/). It
touches on a bunch of stuff that would usually lead me to post it here.
(Really, it hits the _Sapping Attention_ trifecta: a discussion of the
best ways of visualizing Dunning Log-Likelihood, cryptic allusions to
critical theory; and overly serious discussions of popular TV shows.).
But it's even less proofread and edited than what I usually put here,
and I've lately been more and more reluctant to post things on a Google
site like this, particularly as blogger gets folded more and more into
Google Plus. That's one of the big reasons I don't post here as much as
I used to, honestly. (Another is that I don't want to worry about
embedded javascript). So, [head over there if you want to read
it](http://benschmidt.org/2014/09/11/simpsons-2/).

## While I'm at it, I made a few data visualizations last year that I
only shared on Twitter, but meant to link to from here\: [Those are
linked from a single place on my web
site.](http://benschmidt.org/maps-visualizations-gallery/) My favorite
is the baseball leaderboard, the most popular was either the distorted
subway maps or the career charts, and the most useful, I think, is the
browser of college degrees by school and institution type. There are a
couple others as well. (And there are a few not there that I'll add at
some point.)

As part of an assignment for research I have to find an article with
relevant information on this topic and give the teacher our opinion and
the article. Your article helped me a lot. [hip hop
