Henry asks in the comments whether the decline in evolutionary thought
in the 1890s is the "'Eclipse of Darwinism,' rise or prominence of
neo-Lamarckians and saltationism and kooky discussions of hereditary
mechanisms?" Let's take a look, with our new and improved data (and
better charts, too, compared to earlier in the week--any suggestions on
design?). First,three words very closely tied to the theory of natural
selection.

Three rises from around 1859, _Origin_'s publication date (obviously the
numbers for Spencer are inflated by other Spencers in the world, but the
trend seems like it might be driven by Herbert); and three peaks at
different points from 1885 to 1900, followed by a fall and perhaps a
recovery. The question is: how significant are those falls, and how can
we interpret them? First, let's look at the bookcounts: are those falls
a result of less intensive discussion of the subjects, or of a waning in
interest across all books?

Interesting. This makes it clear that 'evolution' continued to diffuse
across the language as late as 1910; any fall in wordcount could reflect
the fact that it's simply not contentious anymore. Darwin, likewise,
still rises but doesn't fall quite so dramatically. So we could
provisionally read these as saying that the extensiveness of discussion
of evolution increased, even as its intensiveness declined. It would be
great to actually put some sort of numbers on these--occurences of a
word per book it appears in is the obvious metric of intensivity of
discussion. But that won't scale well for rare or common words. We can
create a better one, but first I'll need to fit a curve to
that [bookcounts
chart](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TNwZsQ00_2I/AAAAAAAACFA/-EMMNVCr1Jw/s1600/BookcountsWordcount.png) from
earlier.

(I'm not even going to try to read those Spencer results, given my
uncertainty about how much of that involves the [ancestors of Winston
Churchill and Princess
Diana.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_family) We could write some
just-so stories about it, but that's already too much of a temptation.
(There's probably an Erasmus Darwin spike in there too--but under my
current system, it takes too long--maybe 45 minutes--to get results for
a firstname lastname pair).)

Also interesting is how closely aligned the rises of evolution and
Darwin have become, at least initially; but then in the 1880s, evolution
rises again without a concurrent interest in Darwin. What accompanies
evolution's second wind? Well, I could just pull some words out of a
hat. I'm going to do bookcounts only (got to make the code change the
titles to make that clear):

[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TN7LbnNBaZI/AAAAAAAACFw/KwIaJFFtuvI/s1600/heredity+haeckel+genetic+lamarck+fiske.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Pge31alC_E8/TN7LbnNBaZI/AAAAAAAACFw/KwIaJFFtuvI/s1600/heredity+haeckel+genetic+lamarck+fiske.png)

Henry's neo-Lamarckian explanation may have some currency, although his
curve is so shaky it's hard to impute much meaning to its 1880-1890
spike. Fiske rises right in the period we're talking about, but Haeckel
is a little early. Saltation, which I didn't plot, peaks at 25‰ (first
and only warning--I'm generally going to use [per
mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_mil) instead per cent to describe
numbers on this blog) of books in 1845, and is generally below 10 after
1870.

Heredity, though, is a big winner--it starts rising along with our other
two words, but keeps climbing as they peak out. That's a correlation
that's helpful, because it helps us think about what sort of discourse
of evolution was rising. Henry's 'kooky discussions of hereditary
mechanisms' seems like a likely candidate--after Darwin is somewhat
digested, other theories of evolution keep coming forth.

Now, instead of pulling names out of a hat to analyze, I could have
actually done a full analysis of word and book collocation as I did
yesterday. We could even do it for different periods--words associated
with evolution in the 1870s as opposed to the 1890s. That probably would
have prompted some intuitions about better words to search for in these
charts. (Even now, I'm realizing I should have tried to get lester frank
ward in there, although his names are a little common). Currently those
collocations take too much time. I might try to implement a database
solution that would let us do it much faster sometime later, though.

## Lastly, a caveat (I always bury these at the bottom): these
bookcounts are even more vulnerable to changes in the genre composition
of my library over the years than are the wordcounts. In terms of data
cleaning and segmentation, that's the most important thing I can do.
Some sort of text-based classification would be fun to implement,
although I obviously wouldn't do it as well as some others. Talking to
Ben Gross the other day, I realized that I might be able to batch search
the library of congress or worldcat and end up with call numbers for at
least some of these books, which would be amazing. But if they do allow
batch queries, getting the ugly title and author data from internet
archive to be accepted by their system is probably going to be a pain.
So we'll see if I get it done.

Good stuff again, Ben - to be more specific about 'kooky discussions of
hereditary mechanisms,' it bears noting that, insofar as heredity (or
the lack of an explanation for a plausible mechanism thereof) was taken
to be the chief failing of the natural selection hypothesis, you might
consider plotting "heredity" and "evolution" on the same graph and/or
(probably "or") finding an associated word that might explain around
what, exactly, debates hinged after evolution was accepted by Darwin was
denied (1880s/1890s). Something similar to your work yesterday on
"scientific method" might suffice, yes?
