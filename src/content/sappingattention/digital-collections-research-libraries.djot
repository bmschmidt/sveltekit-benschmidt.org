_\[The following is a revised version of my talk on the 'collaboration'
panel at a conference about "Needs and Opportunities for the Research
Library in the Digital Age" at the American Antiquarian Society in
Worcester last week. Thanks to Paul Erickson for the invitation to
attend, and everyone there for a fascinating weekend.\]_

As a few people here have suggested, there's a lot to be suspicious of
in the foisting of collaboration on unsuspecting researchers. To those
worries about collaboration that have already been brought up (including
[by myself
elsewhere](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/02/going-it-alone.html)),
I'd add the particular suspicions that early-career scholars often bear.
Collaboration is often one of those ambitious things that successful
scholars only seem to turn to in earnest with the security of tenure,
like transnational history or raising children.

But in the last few years, I've turned more and more to working with
digital sources; and in doing so, it turns out collaboration is
essential. It's impossible to escape. And, as everyone says, it really
is wonderful.

But the forms that digital collaboration takes, particularly when it's
most helpful, are very different than the traditional forms of heady
engagement around a shared codex, blackboard, or meal that tend to get
us most sentimental when talking about collaborative work. And that has
important implications for libraries like this, because it suggests that
the way you find your collaborators may be quite different. In some
cases, you may not even know who they are. And the attributes it takes
to attract these invisible collaborators can be quite different from
those that libraries traditionally try to display, though they remain
one that a library like this may have in abundance.

*1. Bookworm Background*

So I want to sketch out the role that collaboration can play for
scholars working around digital sources, particularly on the Bookworm
project that I've worked with at the Cultural Observatory. To explain
that project, I want to make a bit of detour about where I see the
scholarship in my own field, American cultural/intellectual history, at
present. For while I identify as a digital historian, the fact is that
at this point, everyone is using some of the most sophisticated
text-mining algorithms ever developed in their daily research; that's
what search engines are.

In American history, this has led to an efflorescence of excellent and
influential studies of broad conceptual topics--histories of risk or
public opinion, and targeted tracking of the diffusion of individual
thinkers like Nietzsche or Heidegger. But the current execution of such
projects does (or should) rely heavily on digital sources, accessed
through keyword searches.

But while keyword search is good for certain purposes (tracking down a
particular text, finding a book to sell), it's far from ideal for real
historical research. It gives no sense of the scale of the libraries we
are looking at--which, for research purposes, is one of their most
salient characteristics. This loses the sense of scale or importance
that one can get in physical libraries--one knows just how hard it is to
locate a particular needle in a particular haystack, and has a sense of
just how unlikely that particular needle might be. In digital libraries,
the ordered list is all we see. It's as if we're recreating the
closed-stack library for the digital age--only one book comes, and you
never know how or whence.

We currently treat all the books not returned in a keyword search as
_detritus_; we need to treat them as _context._

What does context look like? I would argue that working with digital
texts, "context" and "data" are going to look pretty similar. And that's
how I got lured into researching digital books.

But when the line between 'context' and 'data' gets blurred, something
else happens: the scientists start to return to the libraries, after a
generation of absence. And this creates a whole raft of opportunities
for collaborative and interdisciplinary work. I ended up at Harvard
because two scientists, J.B. Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden, were kind
enough to invite me up for a period of time.

Their previous work had culminated in a paper in _Science_ about trends
in words. If you know this work, it's probably because of the
supplemental materials, particularly the [Google
Ngrams](http://books.google.com/ngrams/) site launched in December 2010.

The reaction of many humanists to Ngrams is to play with it for a few
minutes, and then abandon it in confusion about the meaning of trend
like that for "libraries"\:

[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EADB6_5HRZw/T3nx0SNFvhI/AAAAAAAADIc/QwD87tXPIRY/s640/Library+Ngrams.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EADB6_5HRZw/T3nx0SNFvhI/AAAAAAAADIc/QwD87tXPIRY/s1600/Library+Ngrams.png)

My first message about Ngrams for humanists is generally that the data
is considerably more powerful than you think, and can frequently
generate useful insights. So for instance, you can look at the relative
constellation of words _around_ 'libraries'\* to see how they were
described--

[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QmhdX9uJFIY/T3nMOvtJwhI/AAAAAAAADIU/Ogd1ZXuOYdU/s640/Words+Preceding+Libraries.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QmhdX9uJFIY/T3nMOvtJwhI/AAAAAAAADIU/Ogd1ZXuOYdU/s1600/Words+Preceding+Libraries.png)

\_\--\_and probably find something you didn't know before, or at least
reflect on patterns that weren't clear. (Though you may be familiar with
it, I had never heard of 'traveling' libraries, the blue bump around
1910 in the middle of the chart, and lost about half an hour reading up
on their history when I found they existed).

_\*I didn't say in Worcester that I settled on 'libraries' for this
example because "library" is an almost impossible term to type into the
Ngrams database this way, because of all the bookplates and borrowing
slips that were scanned and OCR'ed.Â Lower-case "library" might have
worked._

But Ngrams does have major problems--mostly particularly the limited
usefulness of a single text base as a proxy for 'culture' writ large to
the exclusion of specific areas. (Print culture, scientific culture,
mass culture, etc), and the lack of access to the individual books
included in the sample. Erez, JB, Martin Camacho and I sought to tackle
this at the Cultural Observatory last fall. We wanted to make a browser
that allows the arbitrary creation of charts for any subfield the user
might want; the Digital Public Library of America had a Beta Sprint
project that provided a useful impetus to rethink Ngrams more along the
lines of a library interface.

This meant we needed a new source of books. Google's are heavily
encumbered by copyright restrictions--moreover, even the metadata is off
limits because of licensing agreements. We ended up choosing instead
choosing the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/index.php) instead.

Since this conference is about independent research libraries, I want to
note that the IA is absolutely one of those, though it's not as old as
the Newberry or the Folger--though I don't have anything at stake, I'd
love to see it join the [IRLA](http://irla.lindahall.org/).

We chose the IA for the DPLA Beta Sprint Bookworm for three major
reasons:

1. They allowed free downloads of text files of scanned books.
2. They had worked through a subproject, the Open Library, to gather
   metadata primarily from libraries that was available under a public
   license and linked to those books.
3. Both of these were exposed through well documented public APIs with
   well structured and fairly consistent metadata.

But this had a curious result: when Martin and I were downloading books
from the IA, they _didn't know_ we were doing it. (Maybe they saw a
million curl requests from Cambridge in two or three days, but maybe
not.)

But nonetheless,we were able to build something that met our needs for
internal research (which I won't talk about here), and moreover, that
\_drove access back to them--\_the read links when you click on the

direct you back to the Internet Archive itself, and the book reader they
developed.

*2. Quality, not Quantity.*

You may be wondering what this has to do with smaller libraries: after
all these, most of the sources we've worked with have been concerned
with the big picture--some ambition to get all the books.

The answer, I think, is that the day is probably coming fairly soon--if
it's not already here--when there will be a single source to go to for
published books. If you believe in market solutions, that will be
Google; if you believe in the university research complex, it will be
Hathi; if you believe in the anarchic potential of the open web, it will
be the Open Library or maybe the DPLA.

But you can only answer so many questions with books. Our latest project
with Bookworm, released last week, was based around an entirely
different collection--arxiv.org, a collection of hundreds of thousands
of scientific preprints maintained by the Cornell libraries, which gives
an incredibly comprehensive view of research in several specific fields
of math and physics. The other collections we're looking into now are
primarily much like this: they are comprehensive in their own way, but
don't have the totalizing ambitions of Google or Hathi. Instead, they
share a set of attributes with them:

- Well cultivated collections
- Strong in a particular area of focus
- High quality metadata
- Metadata particular to the set, giving some attribute (gender,
  location, particular scientific discipline) that is unavailable from
  other standpoints
- APIs and licensing agreements that enable open access

These are the sorts of collections that are going to be interesting to
those looking to think of large collections of texts in the hybrid realm
between data and words, and which can help drive more use of the
collections.

Except for the last point, these are all attributes that many
independent and university collections have in abundance.

There's a sense sometimes that if a library scans all its collections
and gives them away, it will have nothing more to offer. Aside from the
obvious objections (the project of perfectly digitizing physical objects
will never be complete), this misses something important; the chief
asset of many libraries with relation to their holdings is _the metadata
about them_. A digital object still has a home.

If a library creates a digital home for an object, it will likely be the
place that all future uses of that object come back to. (In most cases,
no one will be interested in taking away the right to provide a web
presence for a particular manuscript or artifact--and if the originators
catalog changes, that will take priority for all future uses.). And the
curatorial expertise around those objects make the original holder an
important repository; there needs to be someone who knows the flaws or
biases of a collection or a catalog. But it is equally important for
libraries to know the opportunities and uniqueness of their collections
as well. There's sometimes a sense in the digital humanities community
that linked open data will appear in a blur of RDF triples and
obliterate the need for separate standards. Perhaps this will come, but
I don't think it's soon--and in any case, it's the particularities of
their collections--the bits that are hardest to stuff into a Dublin Core
field--that may be the most useful to researchers working with large
quantities.

## This suggests a different role for collaboration. Libraries remain,
as they have been, an important location for interdisciplinary
collaboration; but increasingly, that collaboration can be so disjointed
in space and time that person to person contact can be downplayed. The
library's role in fostering collaboration may, more and more, be laying
the groundwork to make its collections as attractive a place for
researchers to work, and then seeing what happens. In some ways this is
not so different from the relation of larger libraries to patrons, who
can pass through doors with obscure needs and the libraries will never
see. But with the home for the digital object, that work and its
publication can be more intimately involved with the activities of the
library, and can foster greater and more extensive collaborations going
forward.

Ben, great talk. The flip side of this is insuring that support
(material & financial) for libraries exists across a wide institutional
spectrum, and for further development of projects like the Internet
Archive. Interdisciplinary collaboration is so important, and it remains
an important role for the library, whether local or institutional.
